<chapt>Introduction
<p>
As Unix Systems are becoming more and more popular to even beginners working with computer machines due to its advantages in regards of
stability and functionality, most are somehow disappointed, because those applications don't have a consistent look and each one
behaves different from another. With KDE, developers have an almost perfect way to create first-class applications for Unix desktop
systems to get a wider user community by the mere quality their applications have to offer. Therefore, KDE becomes more and more
popular as a base for programming design, and developers want to take advantage of the possibilities that the system has to offer.


<sect>What you should know already
<p>
For making the best use of this programming handbook, we assume that you already know about the C++ programming language; if not, you
should make yourself familiar with that first. Information about C++ is available through various sources either in printed form at
your local bookstore or by tutorials found on the Internet. Knowledge about the design of Graphical User Interfaces is not required, as
this handbook tries to cover the application design for KDE programs, which also includes an introduction into the <idx/Qt/ toolkit as well
as the <idx/KDE libraries/ and the design of User Interfaces. Also, you should have made yourself comfortable with KDevelop by reading
<htmlurl url="index.html" name="The User Manual to KDevelop">, which contains a descriptive review of the functionality provided by the
IDE.
<sect>About this Handbook
<p>
This handbook has been written to give developers an introduction into KDE application development by using the KDevelop
Integrated Development Environment.

The following chapters therefore give an introduction on how to create projects, explains the sourcecodes already generated and shows
how to extend the given sources on various topics such as <idx/toolbar/s, menu bars and view areas.

Then the dialogeditor is discussed in detail, explaining how widgets are created and covers widget properties settings in detail
for all provided widgets.

Finally, you will learn about several topics that will complete your knowledge in regards of project design and helps you work out
additional issues besides coding such as adding <idx/API/ documentation and extending online-manuals.

<bf/In the next chapter/

we'll take a look at the <idx/Qt/ and <idx/KDE libraries/, showing basic concepts and why things are the way they are.
Also, we will discuss how to create the tutorial applications provided with the <idx/Qt/ toolkit by using KDevelop, so beginners can already
see first results with a few steps, and thereby will learn how to make use of some of KDevelop's best features.

<bf/In the following chapters/ you will learn:
<itemize>
<item>how to create an application with the KAppWizard,
<item>what the project skeleton already provides,
<item>what the code already created means,
<item>how to create your own views,
<item>how to extend your application's functionality by dialog, menu bars and <idx/toolbar/s
<item>how to make your application user friendly by providing help functions and
<item>how to write <idx/SGML/ online documentation.
</itemize>

Additionally, you should look for help by subscribing to the various mailing lists, whose addresses are available on the mentioned
web sites, and on the Usenet newsgroups dedicated to users of KDE and Unix Systems as well as about the C and C++ programming language.

For obtaining help about the KDevelop IDE, you should send requests to our mailinglist at <htmlurl
url="mailto:kdevelop@fara3.cs.uni-potsdam.de" name="kdevelop@fara3.cs.uni-potsdam.de">. Mind that the KDevelop team is dedicated to
provide the means to enable you to program applications and therefore is not intended as a technical support team in cases where the
applications you're developing don't work due to implementation errors or misconfigurations of your operating system. By this, we ask
all users to take advantage of the mailinglist in any case you're running into problems with the use of the IDE itself, as well as for
bug reports and suggestions for improving the functionality of the development environment.

<chapt>The KDE and <idx/Qt/ Libraries
<p>
The Norwegian company Troll Tech (<url url="http://www.troll.no">) provides a so-called GUI toolkit, named <idx/Qt/. Thereby, GUI means
"<bf/G/raphical <bf/U/ser <bf/I/nterface", and therefore, <idx/Qt/-based applications represent themselves with buttons, windows etc,
allowing user input by visualizing the functions an application provides. Such a toolkit is needed for developing graphical
applications that run on the X-Window interface on Unix Systems, because X does not contain a pre-defined user interface itself.
Although other toolkits are also available to create User Interfaces, <idx/Qt/ offers some technical advantages that make application design
very easy. Additionally, the <idx/Qt/ toolkit is also available for Microsoft Windows systems, which allows developers to provide their
applications for both platforms.

The KDE Team (<url url="http://www.kde.org">) joined together with the goal to make using Unix
Systems more friendly, and decided to use the <idx/Qt/ toolkit for the development of a window manager on X-Window, plus a variety of tools
included with the KDE packages. The K Desktop Environment therefore contains the window manager <em/kwm/, the file manager <em/kfm/ and
the launch panel <em/kpanel/ as the main components plus a variety of first-class utilities and applications. After KDE was out, a lot
of developers turned their eyes towards the new environment and what it has to offer them. The <idx/KDE libraries/ are providing essential
methods and classes that make all applications designed with them look similar and consistent, so the user has the great advantage that
he only has to get accustomed with an application's specific usage, not with handling dialogs or buttons. Also, KDE programs integrate
themselves into the desktop and are able to interact with the file manager via <idx/drag'n drop/, offer session management and many more,
if all features offered by the <idx/KDE libraries/ are used.

Both, the <idx/Qt/ toolkit and the <idx/KDE libraries/, are implemented in the C++ programming language; therefore applications that make use of
these libraries are also mostly written in C++. In the following chapter, we'll make a short trip through the libraries to see what
already is provided and how <idx/Qt/ and <idx/KDE applications/ are created in general.

<sect>The <idx/Qt/ GUI Toolkit
<p>
As said, the <idx/Qt/ library is a toolkit that offers graphical elements that are used for creating GUI applications and are needed for
X-Window programming. Additionally, the toolkit offers:

<itemize>
<item>A complete set of classes and methods ready to use even for non-graphical programming issues,
<item>A good solution towards user interaction by virtual methods and the signal/slot mechanism,
<item>A set of predefined GUI-elements, called "widgets", that can be used easily for creating the visible elements
<item>Additional completely pre-defined dialogs that are often used in applications such as progress and file dialogs.
</itemize>

Therefore knowing the <idx/Qt/ classes is very essential, even if you only want to program KDE-applications. To have an impression on the
basic concept how GUI-applications are constructed and compiled, we'll first have a look at a sample <idx/Qt/-only program; then we'll extend
it to a KDE program.

<sect1>The first <idx/Qt/ Application
<p>
As usual, programs in C++ have to contain a <tt/main()/ function, which is the starting point for application execution. As we want
them to be graphically visible in windows and offering user interaction, we first have to know, how they can show themselves to the
user. For an example, we'll have a look at the first tutorial included with the <idx/Qt/ Online Reference Documentation and explain the basic
execution steps; also why and how the application window appears:

<tscreen><code>
#include <qapplication.h>
#include <qpushbutton.h>

int main( int argc, char **argv )
{
QApplication a( argc, argv );

QPushButton hello( "Hello world!" );
hello.resize( 100, 30 );

a.setMainWidget( &amp;hello );
hello.show();
return a.exec();
}
</code></tscreen>

This application merely paints a window containing a button with "Hello world" as its text. As for all <idx/Qt/-based applications, you first
have to create an instance of the class <tt/<cdx/QApplication//, represented by <tt/a/.

Next, the program creates an instance of the class <tt/QPushButton/ called <tt/hello/,  this will be the button. The constructor of
<tt/hello/ gets a string as a parameter, which is the contents of the widget visible as the buttons text.

Then the <tt/resize()/ method is called on the <tt/hello/ button. This changes the default size a widget (which is in this
case the QPushButton) has when created to the length of 100 pixels and the height of 30 pixels. Finally, the <tt/setMainWidget()/
method is called for <tt/a/ and the <tt/show()/ method for <tt/hello/. The <tt/<cdx/QApplication// is finally executed by <tt/a.exec()/,
enters the main event loop and waits until it has to return an integer value to the overlaying Operating System signaling that the
application is exited.

<sect1>The Reference Documentation for <idx/Qt/
<p>
Now, let's have a quick look at the reference documentation of the <idx/Qt/ library. To do this, start KDevelop and select "<idx/Qt/-library" from
the "Help"-menu in the menubar. The documentation browser opens and shows you the start page of the <idx/Qt/ reference. This will be your
first place to get information about <idx/Qt/, it's classes and the available functions they provide. Also, the above program is the first
that is included in the tutorials section. To get to the classes we want to have a look at, <tt/<cdx/QApplication// and <tt/QPushButton/,
select "Alphabetical Class List" and search for the according names. Follow either of them to have a look at the <idx/class documentation/.

For <tt/<cdx/QApplication//, you will see the constructor and all other methods that this class provides. If you follow a link, you will get
more information about the usage and meaning of the methods, which is very useful when you sometimes can't detect the correct use or
want to have an example. This also counts for the KDE library documentation, which uses a similar documentation type; therefore this is
almost all you have to know about using the class-references with the documentation browser.

<sect1>Interpretation of the Sample
<p>
Starting with <tt/<cdx/QApplication//, you will find all the methods used in our first example:

<itemize>
<item>the constructor <tt/<cdx/QApplication/()/,
<item>the <tt/setMainWidget()/ method and
<item>the <tt/exec()/ method.
</itemize>

The interpretation why we use these methods is very simple:

<enum>
<item>first create an instance of the class <tt/<cdx/QApplication// with the constructor, so we can make use of the GUI elements provided by
<idx/Qt/,
<item>create a widget which will be the contents of our program window,
<item>set the widget as the main widget for <tt/a/,
<item>execute the <tt/a/ instance of <tt/<cdx/QApplication//.
</enum>

The second object of our program is the pushbutton, an instance of the class <tt/QPushButton/. From the two constructors given to
create an instance, we used the second: this accepts a text, which is the label contents of the button; here, it is the string "Hello
world!". Then we called the <tt/resize()/ method to change the size of the button according to it's contents- the button has to be
larger to make the string completely visible.

But what about the <tt/show()/ method ?  Now, you see that like most other widgets, <tt/QPushButton/ is based on a single-inheritance-
here, the documentation says, <em/Inherits/ <tt/<cdx/QButton//.  Follow the link to the <tt/<cdx/QButton// class. This shows you a lot of other
methodss that are inherited by QPushButton, which we'll use later to explain the signal/slot mechanism. Anyway, the <tt/show()/ method
is not listed, therefore, it must be a method that is provided by inheritance as well. The class that <tt/<cdx/QButton// inherits, is
<tt/<cdx/QWidget//. Just follow the link again, and you will see a whole bunch of methods that the <tt/<cdx/QWidget// class provides; including the
<tt/show()/ method. Now we understand what was done in the sample with the button:

<enum>
<item>create an instance of <tt/QPushButton/, use the second constructor to set the buttons text,
<item>resize the widget to it's contents,
<item>set the widget as the main widget of the <tt/<cdx/QApplication// instance <tt/a/,
<item>tell the widget to display itself on the screen by calling <tt/show()/, an inherited method from <tt/<cdx/QWidget//.
</enum>

After calling the <tt/exec()/ method, the application is visible to the user, showing a window with the button showing "Hello world!".
Now, GUI programs behave somewhat differently than procedural applications. The main thing here is that the application enters a
so-called "main event loop". This means that the program has to wait for user actions and then react to it, also that for a <idx/Qt/
application, the program has to be in the main event loop to start the event handling. The next section tells you in short what this
means to the programmer and what <idx/Qt/ offers to process user events.

(For already advanced users: The button has no parent declared in the constructor, therefore it is a top-level widget alone and runs in
a local event loop which doesn't need to wait for the main event loop, see the <tt/<cdx/QWidget// <idx/class documentation/ and <htmlurl
url="kde_libref.html" name="The KDE Library Reference Guide">)

<bf/Summary:/

A <idx/Qt/ application always has to have one instance of the class <tt/<cdx/QApplication//. This provides that we can create windows that are the
graphical representation of programs to the user and allow interaction. The window contents itself is called a "Main Widget", meaning
that all graphical elements are based on the class <tt/<cdx/QWidget// and can be any type of widget that fits the needs of the application to
communicate with the user. Therefore, all user elements somehow have to inherit <tt/<cdx/QWidget// to be visible.

<sect1>User Interaction
<p>
After reading the last sections, you should already know:
<itemize>
<item>What the <idx/Qt/-library provides in terms of GUI applications,
<item>how a program using <idx/Qt/ is created and
<item>where and how to find information about classes that you want to use with the documentation browser
</itemize>

Now we'll turn to give the application "life" by processing user events. Generally, the user has two ways to interact with a program:
the mouse and the keyboard. For both ways, a graphical user interface has to provide methods that detect actions and methods that do
something as a reaction to these actions.

The Window system therefore sends all interaction events to the according application. The <cdx/QApplication/ then sends them to the active
window as a <tt/<cdx/QEvent// and the widgets themselves have to decide what to do with them. A widget receives the event and processes
<tt/<cdx/QWidget//::event(<cdx/QEvent/*)/, which then decides which event has been executed and how to react; event() is therefore the main event
handler. Then, the <tt/event()/ function passes the event to so-called event filters, that determine what happened and what to do with
the event. If no filter signs responsible for the event, the specialized event handlers are called. Thereby we can decide between:

<bf/a) Keyboard events --TAB and Shift-TAB keys:/

changes the keyboard input focus from the current widget to the next widget in the focus order. The focus can be set to widgets by
calling <tt/setFocusPolicy<ncdx/setFocusPolicy()/()/ and process the following event handlers:

<itemize>
<item><tt/virtual void focusInEvent<ncdx/focusInEvent()/ ( <cdx/QFocusEvent/ * )/
<item><tt/virtual void focusOutEvent<ncdx/focusOutEvent()/ ( <cdx/QFocusEvent/ * )/
</itemize>

<bf/b) all other keyboard input:/
<itemize>
<item><tt/virtual void keyPressEvent<ncdx/keyPressEvent()/ ( <cdx/QKeyEvent/ * )/
<item><tt/virtual void keyReleaseEvent<ncdx/keyReleaseEvent()/ ( <cdx/QKeyEvent/ * )/
</itemize>

<bf/c) mouse movements:/
<itemize>
<item><tt/virtual void mouseMoveEvent ( <cdx/QMouseEvent/ * )/
<item><tt/virtual void enterEvent ( <cdx/QEvent/ * )/
<item><tt/virtual void leaveEvent ( <cdx/QEvent/ * )/
</itemize>

<bf/d) mouse button actions:/
<itemize>
<item><tt/virtual void mousePressEvent ( <cdx/QMouseEvent/ * )/
<item><tt/virtual void mouseReleaseEvent ( <cdx/QMouseEvent/ * )/
<item><tt/virtual void mouseDoubleClickEvent ( <cdx/QMouseEvent/ * )/
</itemize>

<bf/e) window events containing the widget:/
<itemize>
<item><tt/virtual void moveEvent ( <cdx/QMoveEvent/ * )/
<item><tt/virtual void resizeEvent ( <cdx/QResizeEvent/ * )/
<item><tt/virtual void closeEvent ( <cdx/QCloseEvent/ * )/
</itemize>


Note that all event functions are virtual and protected; therefore you can re-implement the events that you need in your own
widgets and specify how your widget has to react. <tt/<cdx/QWidget// also contains some other virtual methods that can be useful in your
programs; anyway, it is sufficient to know about <tt/<cdx/QWidget// very well generally.

<sect1>Object Interaction by Signals and Slots
<p>
Now we're coming to the most obvious advantages of the <idx/Qt/ toolkit: the signal/slot mechanism. This offers a very handy and useful
solution to object interaction, which usually is solved by <tt/callback/ functions for X-Window toolkits. As this communication
requires a strict programming and sometimes makes user interface creation very difficult (as referred by the <idx/Qt/ documentation and
explained in <em/Programming with <idx/Qt// by K.Dalheimer), Troll Tech invented a new system where objects can emit signals that can be
connected to methods declared as slots. For the C++ part of the programmer, he only has to know some things about this mechanism:

<enum>
<item>the class declaration of a class using signals/slots has to contain the <tt/Q_OBJECT/ macro at the beginning (without the
semicolon); and have to be derived from the <tt/QObject/ class,
<item>a signal can be emitted by the keyword <tt/emit/, e.g. <tt/emit signal(parameters);/ from within any member function
of a class that allows signals/slots,
<item>all signals used by the classes that are not inherited have to be added to the class declaration by a <tt/signals:/ section,
<item>all methods that can be connected with a signal are declared in sections with the additional keyword <tt/slot/, e.g.
<tt/<bf/public/ slots:/ within the class declaration,
<item>the meta-object compiler <tt/moc/ has to run over the header file to expand the macros and to produce the implementation (which
is not needed to know.). The output files of <tt/moc/ are compiled as well by the C++ compiler.
</enum>

Another way to use signals without deriving from <tt/QObject/ is to use the <tt/QSignal/ class- see the reference documentation for
more information and example usage. In the following, we assume you're deriving from <tt/QObject/.


This way, your class is able to send signals anywhere and to provide slots that signals can connect to. By using the signals, you don't
have to care about who's receiving it- you just have to emit the signal and whatever slot you want to connect to it can react to the
emission. Also the slots can be used as normal methods during implementation.

Now, to connect a signal to a slot, you have to use the <tt/connect()/ methods that are provided by <tt/QObject/ or, where available,
special methods that objects provide to set the connection for a certain signal.


<sect2>Sample Usage
<p>
To explain the way how to set up object-interaction, we'll take our first example again and extend it by a simple connection:

<tscreen><code>
#include <qapplication.h>
#include <qpushbutton.h>

int main( int argc, char **argv )
{
QApplication a( argc, argv );

QPushButton hello( "Hello world!" );
hello.resize( 100, 30 );

a.setMainWidget( &amp;hello );

connect(&amp;hello, SIGNAL( clicked() ), &amp;a, SLOT( quit() );

hello.show();
return a.exec();
}
</code></tscreen>

You see, the only addition to give the button more interaction is to use a <tt/connect()/ method:
<tt/connect(&amp;hello, SIGNAL( clicked() ), &amp;a, SLOT( quit() );/ is all you have to add. What is the meaning now ? The class
declaration of <tt/QObject/ says about the <tt/connect()/ method:

<tt/bool connect ( const QObject * sender, const char * signal, const QObject * receiver, const char * member )/

This means, you have to specify a QObject instance pointer that is the sender of the signal, meaning that it can emit this signal as
first parameter; then you have to specify the signal that you want to connect to. The last two parameters are the receiver object that
provides a slot, followed by the member function which actually <em/is/ the slot that will be executed on signal emission.

By using signals and slots, your program's objects can interact with each other easily without explicitely depending on the type of
the receiver object. You will learn more about using this mechanism for productive usage later in this handbook. More information about
the Signals/Slot mechanism can also be found in <htmlurl url="kde_libref.html" name="The KDE Library Reference Guide"> and the <idx/Qt/
online reference.

<sect>What KDE provides
<p>
<sect1>The KDE 1.1.x libraries
<p>
For the time of this writing and due to the fact that KDevelop uses KDE 1.1, I'm referring to the state of the <idx/KDE libraries/ at that
release. The main <idx/KDE libraries/ you'll be using for creating your own <idx/KDE applications/ are:

<itemize>
<item>the KDE-Core library, containing all classes that are non-visible elements and provide functionality your application may use.
<item>the KDE-UI library, containing user interface elements like menu bars, <idx/toolbar/s and the like,
<item>the KFile library, containing the file selection dialogs,
</itemize>

Additionally, for specific solutions KDE offers the following libraries:

<itemize>
<item>the KHTMLW library, offering a complete HTML-interpreting widget that is used by various programs like <idx/KDEHelp/, KFM, KDevelop,
<item>the KFM library, allowing to use the KDE file manager from within your application.
<item>the KAb library, the KAddressBook. Provides address-book access for e.g. email applications
<item>the KSpell library, offering widgets and functionality to integrate the use of Ispell, the common spell-checker, in applications
like editors; used for the KEdit application.
</itemize>

Next, we'll have a look at what is needed to turn our first <idx/Qt/ application into a KDE one.

<sect1>Example KDE Application
<p>
In the following, you will see that writing a KDE application is not much more difficult than a <idx/Qt/ application. For the use of KDE's
features, you just have to use some other classes, and you're almost done. As an example, we'll discuss the changed version of the <idx/Qt/
example from above:

<tscreen><code>
#include <kapp.h>
#include <qpushbutton.h>

int main( int argc, char **argv )
{
KApplication a( argc, argv );

QPushButton hello( "Hello world!" );
hello.resize( 100, 30 );

a.setTopWidget( &amp;hello );

connect(&amp;hello, SIGNAL( clicked() ), &amp;a, SLOT( quit() );

hello.show();
return a.exec();
}
</code></tscreen>

You see that first we have changed from <tt/<cdx/QApplication// to <tt/<cdx/KApplication//. Further, we had to change the previously used
<tt/setMainWidget()/ method to <tt/setTopWidget/, which <tt/<cdx/KApplication// uses to set the main widget. That's it ! Your first KDE
application is ready- you only have to tell the compiler the KDE include path and the linker to link in the KDE-Core library with
-lkdecore.

As you now know what at least the main() function provides generally and how an application gets visible and allows user and object
interaction, we'll go on with the next chapter, where our first application is made with KDevelop- there you can also test everything
which was mentioned before and see the effects.

What you should have looked into additionally until now is the reference documentation for <idx/Qt/, especially the <tt/<cdx/QApplication//,
<tt/<cdx/QWidget// and <tt/QObject/ class and the KDE-Core library documentation for the <tt/<cdx/KApplication// class. The <htmlurl
url="kde_libref-3.html" name="KDE Library Reference"> handbook also covers a complete description about the invocation of the
<tt/<cdx/QApplication// and <tt/<cdx/KApplication// constructors including command-line argument processing.

<chapt>Creating new Applications<label id="Creating new Applications">
<p>
The KAppWizard, or also called the KDE Application Wizard, is intended to let you start working on new projects with KDevelop.
Therefore, all your projects are first created by the wizard; then you can start building them and extend the already provided source
skeleton. KAppWizard also allows to choose between several project types according to your project's goals:

<itemize>
<item>Normal KDE Application: includes source code for a complete frame structure of a standard KDE application with support for the
Document-View-Controller model, a menubar, <idx/toolbar/ and statusbar as well as a set of standard documentation based on <idx/SGML/, KDE-links
and application icons. This is the application type usually needed for a new KDE project.
<item>Mini KDE Application: contains the same general structure as the Normal KDE Application type but with the difference that the
application's code only provides a widget as a window.
<item>Normal <idx/Qt/ Application: works like the normal KDE application by it's code with the difference that the project is based on the <idx/Qt/
library only and doesn't contain KDE support. This is intended for projects that have to be portable to Windows platforms or that don't
want to require <idx/KDE libraries/ by the end-user.
<item>C Application: Is based on the C compiler only and runs in a console.
<item>C++ Application: Is based on the C++ compiler only and runs in a console like the C application, therefore doesn't require
X-Window.
<item>Custom project: creates an empty project without any sourcecode. This is intended for already existing projects to port
to KDevelop or for projects where you want to start from scratch. Mind that you have to take care for makefiles and configure scripts
all by yourself.
</itemize>

In this chapter we'll see how the KAppWizard can be invoked and what has to be done to generate a KDE application project. This will
also be the initial step of our coverage, where we will create the initial version of a sample project. For all other project types the
steps are usually the same, just you may not have certain options available.

<sect>Invoking KAppWizard and Project Generation
<p>
<sect1>Starting KAppWizard and the First Page
<p>
To start with your first KDE application, open KDevelop. Then select "New..." from the "Project"-menu. The KAppWizard starts, and you
see a tree on the first page, containing the project types. When a type is selected, you see a preview how it will look like after the
initial build process. Choose the KDE subtree, Normal type. Then press the "Next" button on the bottom of the first wizard page. This
will switch to the next page, where you have to set the general project options.

<sect1>The Generate Settings Page
<p>
For our sample application, we choose the project name <tt/KScribble/; therefore insert this in the field "Projectname". Then select
the directory you want to have your project build in; the default is your home directory. You can enter the path manually or you can as
well press the button on the right to select the directory by a dialog.

Next, you have to enter the Version number. For the first version, set this to <tt/0.1/. It is usual to number new applications that are
in development for the first release lower than 1, and as the initial version will only contain the standard framework, we'll name this
the 0.1 version.

Finally, add your name to the "Author" field and your email address. You can leave all other options to their default settings.

To give you some information about all other options, you can press the right mouse button over the options, and you will get a quick-help
window that describes the option's purpose.

These are:
<itemize>
<item><bf/generate sources and headers:/  generates the application source code
<item><bf/GNU-Standard-Files:/  adds a copy of the GNU-General Public License to the project as well as some standard files for user
information when distributing the package.
<item><bf/User-Documentation:/ the user handbook in <idx/SGML/, already prepared for your project.
<item><bf/<idx/API/-Documentation:/ creates an initial HTML documentation set for the <bf/A/pplication <bf/P/rogramming <bf/I/nterface.
<item><bf/lsm-File:/ the Linux Software Map, used by distribution sites and contains short information about the project's purpose and
requirements.
<item><bf/<idx/.kdelnk/-File: / a KDE link that will install your application in the "Applications" tree of the KDE-Panel.
<item><bf/Program-Icon: / an Icon that represents your project and can be used to create a link on the desktop.
<item><bf/Mini-Icon: / a Mini-version of the program icon that represents your application besides its name in the KDE-Panel and is
shown in your application's dialogs and main-window in the left upper corner.
</itemize>

Now we'll switch to the next page by pressing the "Next" button again to set the template for the header files of your project.


<sect1>The Header and Source Templates
<p>
The header template page allows you to automatically include a preface for your header files, containing the filename, the construction
date, the year of the copyright, also your name and your email address. You don't have to change those uppercase parts yourself, as
KAppWizard does this automatically and stores the template for this project, so it can be used later again for creating new files.

The second part of the default header template contains a license information. By default, your project is set under the GNU General
Public License, which is also included in the package. This license is used to protect your source code against any person that just
copies your sources for his own purpose. The General Public License offers you this license for free and thereby protects your rights
as the author, and is common for distributing free software. To get more information about the license, you should read the COPYING
file in the base directory of your new project later which is a copy of the GPL and ships with your application already.

Anyway, you may want to choose another license or another header template you're already using for your projects. Therefore you can
either edit the given default template directly. To do this, you're given the template in an editing window. To clear the default page,
select "New", to use another template, select "Load...", which lets you choose the template file.

When you're done, go to the next page by entering "Next". This is the template page for your source files and is generally the same as
the header template page. The only difference is that this template is used for your implementation files.

<sect1>Creating the Project
<p>

Now that you've set all options for <em/KScribble/, select "Next" and press the "Generate" button on the bottom of the wizard window.
If the button is not available, you haven't set all options correctly. To correct any errors, step back in the Wizard with "Back".

Then you'll see what KAppWizard does- he copies all templates to your project directory and creates the new project. After KAppWizard
is finished, the "Cancel" button changes to an "Exit" button to leave the wizard.

After this last step, you're finished with creating a new project. KDevelop then loads it and the tree-views let you browse through the
project's files and classes.


In the next section, we'll discuss how to build and run your first version of <em/KScribble/ and how the source code is organized.

<sect>The First Build
<p>
After our project is generated, we'll first make a trip through the source code to get a general understanding how the application frame
works. This won't only help to get started but we'll know where to change what in later steps.

When opening the LFV (Logical File Viewer) page on the tree-view, you see some folders that already sort the project files relevant to
the developer. The first two folders are "Header" and "Sources". The Header-folder therefore logically contains all header files of the
project, the Sources-folder all sourcecodes. All other folders are of no interest right now, so we'll turn back here later to see what
they contain.

The two folders then contain the following files:

<bf/Headers:/
<itemize>
<item><bf/kscribble.h :/ contains the class declaration for the class <bf/KScribbleApp/.
<item><bf/kscribbledoc.h :/ contains the class declaration for the class <bf/KScribbleDoc/.
<item><bf/kscribbleview.h :/ contains the class declaration for the class <bf/KScribbleView/.
<item><bf/resource.h :/ contains a macro collection for the menu-ID's
</itemize>

<bf/Sources:/
<itemize>
<item><bf/kscribble.cpp :/ contains the implementation of the class <bf/KScribbleApp/.
<item><bf/kscribbledoc.cpp :/ contains the implementation of the class <bf/KScribbleDoc/.
<item><bf/kscribbleview.cpp :/ contains the implementation of the class <bf/KScribbleView/.
<item><bf/main.cpp :/ contains the <bf/main()/ function implementation.
</itemize>

Before diving into the sources, we'll let KDevelop build and run our new application. To do this, select "Make" from the "Build"-menu
or hit the according button on the <idx/toolbar/. The output window opens from the bottom of KDevelop and lets you see what <tt/make/ does by
the messages it gives us:

</code></tscreen>
<p>
As you see, we've put line-numbers in front of each line, which won't appear in your output; it just makes it easier to describe what
happened during the build now. First of all, <tt/make/ works recursively. That means, it starts from the directory it is invoked in and
then goes into the subdirectories first, returns and processes the next directory. Finally, the directory it was started is processed
and <tt/make/ finishes. Therefore, <tt/make/ started in the main project directory containing the sources first. In line 1 and 2, you
see how the <tt/make/ process goes into the <tt/docs/ directory, then into the <tt/en/ subdirectory. As there isn't anything to do, it
leaves these directories until it returns to the source-directory <tt/kscribble/ in line 11. Then, the real work starts: <tt/make/
invokes the compiler, here <tt/g++/ to compile the source-file <tt/kscribbleview.cpp/. The macro <tt/-DHAVE_CONFIG_H/ says that the file
<tt/config.h/ should be used. This is a file containing macros for the specific platform and application and is located in the main
project directory. The following <tt/-I/ commands add the include path where <tt/g++/ can find the includes it needs. These are the
current directory, the main project directory (by <tt/-I../) and the include path for the KDE, <idx/Qt/ and X11 library header files. The
directories for these include files were determined by the <tt/configure/ script and set in the Makefiles, therefore, the compiler
knows where these are located. Finally, <tt/-O0/ sets the optimization to zero (no optimization), <tt/-g/ enables debugging, <tt/-Wall/
sets the compiler warnings to <tt/all/ and <tt/-c/ tells the compiler to produce an object file, so only compile the file.

This is done for the other source-files of our project as well in lines 13-15. Obviously, our sources are compiled, but instead of
linking the object files of the sources to the final binary, we see some other commands. In line 16, you see that the program "moc" is
called to process the header-file  <tt/kscribble.h/, with it's output in <tt/kscribble.moc.cpp/. Then, in line 17, this source file is
compiled as well. The same happens with the other project header files until line 21. Now, as the <idx/Qt/ toolkit contains the signal/slot
mechanism, but still stays a C++ implementation, you're using certain keywords that are not originally C++ language, such as the
<tt/signals:/ and <tt/slots:/ declaration in your classes. This gives you the ability to easily allow object communication for all
class objects that inherit the class <tt/QObject/, so you can avoid the usual callback pointer functions. Therefore, the application
needs the sources that implement this functionality, and that is why <tt/moc/ is called. <tt/Moc/ is the Meta Object Compiler of the <idx/Qt/
toolkit and builds the implementation for signals and slots mechanisms by parsing the header file and producing a source output that
has to be compiled in the binary. As KDevelop projects use <tt/automoc/ to determine, which header file needs to be processed, you
don't have to take care for any call on <tt/moc/ and the C++ compiler on the moc output files. Just remember the rules that make a
class use the signals and slots- inheritance from <tt/QObject/ or any class that inherits <tt/QObject/ itself, inclusion of the
<tt/Q_OBJECT/ macro (without semicolon !) at the beginning of the class declaration and the declarations for signals and slots.

Finally, your binary is built by the compiler. The output binary is called <tt/kscribble/, the linker includes the path for the KDE and
X11 libraries and links the sources against the libraries <tt/kfile, kfm, kdeui, kdecore, qt, Xext/ and <tt/X11/. Then you're done and
make exits.

<sect>The Source Skeleton
<p>

To gain a concept of how a KDE application works, we'll first have a very close look at the source skeleton already provided by the
Application Wizard. As we already saw, we're having a set of source and header files that build the initial code for the application
and make it ready-to-run. Therefore, the easiest way to explain the code is to follow the implementation line by line as it is
processed during executing the program until it enters the main event loop and is ready to accept user input. Then, we'll have a look
at the functionality that enables user interaction and how certain things work. This is probably the best way to explain the framework
and, as it is similar to almost all <idx/KDE applications/, will enable you to read source codes from other projects as well; additionally,
you will know where to change what part of the code to make your applications behave the way they are designed for.

<sect1>The <tt/main()/ Function<label id="The main() Function">
<p>
As the application begins its execution with entering the <tt/main()/ function, this will be the start for our code examination. The
<tt/main()/ function of <em/KScribble/ is implemented in the file <tt/main.cpp/ and can also be found using the Class Browser by
selecting the "Globals" folder, sub-folder "Functions":

<tscreen><code>
1  #include "kscribble.h"
2
3  int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
4    KApplication app(argc,argv,"KScribble");
5
6    if (app.isRestored())
7    {
8       RESTORE(KScribbleApp);
9    }
10   else
11   {
12      KScribbleApp* kscribble = new KScribbleApp;
13      kscribble->show();
14      if(argc > 1){
15        kscribble->openFile(argv[1]);
16      }
17    }
18    return app.exec();
19  }
</code></tscreen>

Now, what happens first is the usual creation of a <tt/<cdx/KApplication// object, which gets our application name <em/KScribble/ as a third
parameter. When creating a new <tt/<cdx/KApplication//, a new <tt/<cdx/KConfig// instance is created as well which is connected to a configuration
file in $HOME/.kde/share/config/appname + rc which stores all information we want to use when starting application windows. The name we
passed the constructor of <tt/app/ will be used as the window title later.

Despite of the example code for turning the first <idx/Qt/ application into a KDE one, the following code is somewhat different. After the
<tt/<cdx/KApplication// object is present, we're testing if the application is started by the session management of <tt/kwm/ or manually by
the user. This can be found out when calling <tt/isRestored()/ on the <tt/app/ object, which returns <tt/true/ for session management
and <tt/false/ for a normal start.

As session management is a main feature of <idx/KDE applications/ and widely used by the framework but a lot more to explain, we'll follow
the <tt/else{}/ section first; then we'll come back and explain the session functionality in a later step.

<sect1>User Application Start
<p>
The <tt/else{}/ section now creates an instance of the class <tt/KScribbleApp/ in line 12. This object is called to show itself in line
13 as usual; line 14 determines if a command-line argument has been passed and, as this is usually the name of a file, calls the
<tt/kscribble/ object to open it with <tt/openFile()/.

Note that we didn't call the method <tt/setTopWidget(kscribble)/ for our application- this is already done by the class that <tt/KScribbleApp/
inherits. Now we'll have a look at our <tt/KScribbleApp/ object- what is it and what does it provide already ?  The only thing we know
until now is that it has to be a Widget to represent the user interface in the main window. Let's turn to the class implementation of
<tt/KScribbleApp/, which can be found in the file <tt/kscribble.cpp/ or by a click on the class icon in the Class Browser. As the
instance is created by the constructor.
First of all, we see that it inherits the class <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow//, which is a part of the <tt/kdeui/ library. This class itself
inherits <tt/<cdx/QWidget//, so, as usual, we have a normal widget as the top-level window. <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow// contains a lot of functionality
that the class <tt/KScribbleApp/ makes use of. It provides a menubar, <idx/toolbar/, statusbar and session management support. The only thing
we have to do when sub-classing <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow// is to create all the objects we need and create another widget that is managed by our
<tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow// instance as the main view in the center of the window; usually this is the place where the user works like a
text-editing view.

<sect2>The Constructor
<p>
Let's have a look at the code for the constructor and see how the instance is created:

<tscreen><code>
1   KScribbleApp::KScribbleApp()
2   {
3     config=kapp->getConfig();
4	
5
6     ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
7     // call inits to invoke all other construction parts
8     initMenuBar();
9     initToolBar();
10    initStatusBar();
11    initKeyAccel();
12    initDocument();
13    initView();
14
15    readOptions();
16
17    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
18    // disable menu and toolbar items at startup
19    disableCommand(ID_FILE_SAVE);
20    disableCommand(ID_FILE_SAVE_AS);
21    disableCommand(ID_FILE_PRINT);
22
23    disableCommand(ID_EDIT_CUT);
24    disableCommand(ID_EDIT_COPY);
25    disableCommand(ID_EDIT_PASTE);
26  }
</code></tscreen>

We see that our config instance of <tt/<cdx/KConfig// now points to the applications configuration, so we can operate
with the configuration file entries later.

Then, all parts of the application that are needed are created by their according member functions that are specific to our main
window:

<itemize>
<item><bf/initMenuBar():/  constructs the menubar,
<item><bf/initToolBar():/  constructs the <idx/toolbar/,
<item><bf/initStatusBar():/ creates the statusbar,
<item><bf/initKeyAccel():/  sets all keyboard accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s for our application by the global and application specific keyboard
configuration
<item><bf/initDocument():/ creates the document object for the application window
<item><bf/initView():/      creates the main widget for our view within the main window
<item><bf/readOptions():/  reads all application specific settings from the configuration file and initializes the rest of the
application such as the recent file list, the bar positions and the window size.
</itemize>

Finally, we disable some commands that the user can do, because they should not be available in the current application state.
As we now have a general overview how the application window is created, we will look into the details of how the user elements are
constructed by following the above methods.

<sect2>The Menubar
<p>
As shown above, the menubar of <em/KScribble/ is created by the method <tt/initMenuBar()/. There, we create a set of
<tt/<cdx/QPopupMenu//s that pop up if the user selected a menuentry. Then, we insert them into the menubar and connect to the entries.

First, we create our <tt/recent_file_menu/, which will contain the names of the last 5 opened files. We have to do this first, because
this menu is inserted into the <tt/file_menu/. Then we add the connection directly- we just retrieve the signal that is emitted by the
menuentry with its entry number and call the <tt/slotFileOpenRecent( int )/, which then calls the right file from the recent file list
to be opened.

Then we create our "File"-menu. This will be the menu that will be visible in the menubar. The standard actions are then inserted into
the popup-menu one by one- first the commands for creating a new file, open a file, close a file etc., finally "E&amp;xit" to close the
application. All menu entries have to be created in the order as they appear later, so we have to keep an eye on which we want to have
at what place. As an example, we look at the following entries:

<tscreen><verb>
file_menu->insertItem(Icon("fileopen.xpm"), i18n("&amp;Open..."), ID_FILE_OPEN );
file_menu->insertItem(i18n("Open &amp;recent"), recent_files_menu, ID_FILE_OPEN_RECENT );
</verb></tscreen>

The first one inserts the "Open..." entry. As we want to have it with an icon, we use the <tt/insertItem()/ method with the icon's
name. To understand the icon loading process, we need to know what or where <tt/Icon()/ is declared- in fact, it is a macro provided by
the class <tt/<cdx/KApplication//:

<tscreen><verb>
#define Icon(x) kapp->getIconLoader()->loadIcon(x)
</verb></tscreen>
Additionally, it uses the following macro internally to get access to the application object:
<tscreen><verb>
#define kapp KApplication::getKApplication()
</verb></tscreen>

This means that the <tt/<cdx/KApplication// object already contains an Icon loader instance- we only have to get access to it; then it will
load the according icon. As our icons are all from the <idx/KDE libraries/, we don't have to take care for anything else- they are installed
on the system automatically, therefore we also don't have to include them into our application package to use them.

After the icon parameter (which is optional), we insert the menuentry name by <tt/i18n("&amp;Open...")/.  There, we have to watch two
things: first, the entry is inserted with the <tt/i18n()/ method. Like the <tt/Icon()/ entry, it is a macro defined in <tt/<cdx/kapp.h// as
well and calls the <tt/KLocale/ object of <tt/<cdx/KApplication// to translate the entry to the currently used language:

<tscreen><verb>
#define i18n(X) KApplication::getKApplication()->getLocale()->translate(X)
</verb></tscreen>

Hereby, it should be mentioned that one could think "I don't want to use macros"- you can do that in most cases. But here it is
immanent to use <tt/i18n()/ because for internationalization the according language files have to be build. As this build process
depends on the <tt/i18n/ string, you have to use the macro.

As you might have already guessed, the ampersand within menu entries is later interpreted as a line under the following letter in the
menuentry. This allows fast access to the menu command via the keyboard when the user presses the <tt/Alt/-key in conjuction with the
underlined letter.

Finally, we're giving the menuentry an ID, which is an integer value by which we can find the entry later. To keep
an overview over the used values, these are defined by macros and are collected in the file <tt/resource.h/ within your project. For
consistency, these macros are all uppercase and begin with ID_, then the menu name followed by the entry. This makes it very easy to
remember the sense of each entry anywhere within the code, so you don't have to turn to the menubar implementation again to look up the
entries.

The second example entry shows another variant of the <tt/insertItem()/ method. Here, we add  the recent_files_menu popup menu as a
menuitem. This means, that the entry shows itself with the given string "Open recent", followed by a right arrow. On selection, the
recent file popup menu appears and the user can choose the last file.

Last but not least there are a lot of other ways to insert menu items- the framework keeps this as simple as possible. More information
can be obtained in the <idx/Qt/ documentation about the <tt/<cdx/QMenuData// class.

Now, after we created the popup menus <tt/file_menu, edit_menu/ and <tt/view_menu/, we have to include a "Help"-menu as well. We could
do this like the others as well, but the <tt/<cdx/KApplication// class offers a nice and quick method to cover this:

<tscreen><verb>
help_menu = kapp->getHelpMenu(true, i18n("KScribble\n" VERSION ));
</verb></tscreen>

This is all we have to do to get a help menu that contains an entry for the help contents with the F1 keyboard shortcut<nidx/shortcuts/, an about-box
for the application and an about-box for the KDE (which can be disabled by calling <tt/getHelpMenu(false,...);/).  The contents for our
applications about-box is set with the <tt/i18n()/ string again- VERSION takes the macro that is defined for the project version number
in the file <tt/config.h/, so we don't have to change this every time manually when we want to give out a new release. Feel free to add
any information about your application here, e.g. your name, email address, copyright and the like.

Now we only have to insert the pop-ups into the menubar. As <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow// already constructs a menubar for us, we just insert them
by calling <tt/menuBar()->insertItem();/.

What is left to do is to connect the menu-entries with the methods they will execute. Therefore, we connect each popup menu by its
signal <tt/activated( int )/ to a method <tt/commandCallback( int )/, which contains a <tt/switch/ statement that calls the according
methods for the menu entries. Additionally, we connect the pop-ups by their signal <tt/highlighted( int )/ to provide statusbar help on
each entry. Whenever the user moves his mouse or <idx/keyboard focus/ to an entry, the statusbar then shows the according help message.

After we finished with the menubar, we can continue with the <idx/toolbar/ in the following section. Mind that an instance of a
<tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow// can only have one menubar visible at a time; therefore if you want to construct several menu bars, you have to create
them separately with instances of <tt/<cdx/KMenuBar// and set one of them by the according methods of <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow// as the current
menubar. See the <idx/class documentation/ of <tt/<cdx/KMenuBar// for more detailed information about how to extend the features, also see <ref
id="Configuring Menubars and Toolbars" name="Configuring Menubars and Toolbars">.

<sect2>The Toolbar
<p>
The creation of <idx/toolbar/s now is even simpler than that of menubars. As <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow// already provides <idx/toolbar/s, which are created
by the first insertion, you are free to create several ones. Just add the buttons for the functions you want to provide:

<tscreen><verb>
toolBar()->insertButton(Icon("filenew.xpm"), ID_FILE_NEW, true, i18n("New File") );
</verb></tscreen>

This adds a left-aligned button with the icon "filenew.xpm" with the according ID to the <idx/toolbar/. The third parameter decides if the
button should be enabled or not; by default we set this to <tt/true/, because our <tt/disableCommand()/ methods at the end of the
constructor do this for us automatically for both menu and <idx/toolbar/ entries. Finally, the last parameter is uses as a so-called
"Quick-Tip"- when the user moves the mouse pointer over the button so that it gets highlighted, a small window appears that contains a
short help message, whose contents can be set here.

Finally, all <idx/toolbar/ buttons are connected to our <tt/commandCallback()/ method again by their signal <tt/clicked()/. On the signal
<tt/pressed()/, we let the user receive the according help message in the statusbar.

<bf/Additional Information:/

As <idx/toolbar/s are created using the class <tt/<cdx/KToolBar//, you should have a look at the according documentation. With
<tt/<cdx/KToolBar//, a lot of things needed in a <idx/toolbar/ can be realized such as delayed pop-ups if your button wants to pop up a menu
when the button keeps being pressed or even widgets like combos. Also, by default, the <idx/toolbar/ fills the complete width of the
window, which makes it look nice for using a single bar. When using more than one, you should also think about setting the bar
size to end at the most right button, so other bars can be displayed in the same row below the menubar. We will discuss certain
techniques about designing and extending <idx/toolbar/s in section <ref id="Configuring Menubars and Toolbars" name="Configuring
Menubars and Toolbars">.

<sect2>The Statusbar
<p>
The statusbar is, as well as the other bars, already provided by the <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow// instance, so we just have to insert our items as
we want to. By default, the framework contains only one entry that displays statusbar help. For a lot of applications this may not
last; then you would add the entries you need for displaying e.g. coordinates and the like.

Also, an application can only have one statusbar at a time like a menubar. If you want to construct several ones, you should create
them separately and set the current bar by the according method of <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow//.  The statusbar also offers to insert widgets,
which can be used to produce nice habits for displaying progress-bars like KDevelop does. Refer to the <idx/class documentation/ of
<tt/KStatusBar/.

<sect2>Keyboard Accelerators
<p>
With reaching the method <tt/initKeyAccel()/, we already constructed the standard items of an application main window- the menubar,
<idx/toolbar/ and statusbar. Indeed, we didn't set any keyboard accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s by which advanced users that only want to work with the keyboard
have a quick access to certain commands that are used most often during work with our program. To do this, we could have inserted the
accelerator<nidx/accelerator/ keys by the insertion of the menu-items for example, but KDE offers a good solution to construct and maintain keyboard
accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s. A lot of users want to have them configurable on one hand and on the other standard accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s should be the same over
all applications. Therefore, the KDE control center offers configuring standard keyboard accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s globally by using the
<tt/<cdx/KAccel// class. Additionally, the <idx/KDE libraries/ contain a widget that lets users configure application specific keyboard shortcut<nidx/shortcuts/s
easily. As the application framework only uses menu-items that have standard actions such as "New" or "Exit", these are set by the
method <tt/initKeyAccel()/. Standard actions just have to be connected, for your application specific keyboard values, you have to
insert them first by specifying the keyboard accelerator<nidx/accelerator/ name and then connect them. As our accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s are all present in the
menubar, we have to change the accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s for the popup entries. Finally we call <tt/readSettings()/, which reads the current
settings from the root window of KDE containing the configuration of standard accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s, then the settings for accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s
specified in the application's config file. When we're going further into our example project, we will also talk about how to configure
our application specific accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s by a configuration dialog, see <ref id="Configuring Menubars and Toolbars" name="Configuring
Menubars and Toolbars"> for that part of the development process.

<sect2>The Document-View Model
<p>
The next two member function calls, <tt/initDocument()/ and <tt/initView()/, are finally building the part that the application
windows are supposed to provide to the user: an interface to work with data that the application is supposed to manipulate; and that is
also the reason why the application framework contains three classes, an <tt/*App/, <tt/*View/ and <tt/*Doc/ class. To understand, why
this structure is helpful, we'll look a bit aside the actual code and introduce some theory, then we'll switch to the program again to
see how the KDevelop frameworks support such a model.

Basically, all what has been explained about the framework is that we need an application instance that contains a main window. This
window is responsible to provide the basic interface for the user- it contains the menubar, <idx/toolbar/s and statusbar and the event
controlling for user interaction. Also, it contains an area, that is described as a "view". Now, the purpose of a view is generally, to
display the data that the user can manipulate, e.g. a part of a text file. Although the text file is probably larger than the view is
able to display on the screen, it offers the user to go to the part that he wants to see (therefore it is a view), and there the user
can as well change the data of the file contents. To give the programmer a better way to separate parts of the application by code, the
Document-View Model has been invented. Although not a standard, it provides a structure how an application should work:

<itemize>
<item> The application contains a controller object,
<item> a View object that displays the data the user works with
<item> and a Document object that actually contains the data to manipulate.
</itemize>

Back to the example of working with a text file- there, this model would work the way that the Document would read the file contents and
provides methods to change the data as well as to save the file again. The view then processes the events that the user produces by the
keyboard and the mouse and uses the document object's methods to manipulate the document data.

Finally, the controller object is responsible for user interaction by providing the document and the view objects as well as the
interfaces to send commands like opening and saving. Additionally, certain methods of the view object can be provided by commands that
can be accessed via keyboard accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s or the mouse on menubars and <idx/toolbar/s.

This Document-View model has some advantages- it separates the program's code more object-oriented and by this offers more flexibility
in general, e.g. the same document object could be displayed by two views at the same time; either by a new view in a new window or by
tiling the current one that then contains two view object that build the actual window view region.

Now, if you're coming from MS-Windows systems you may have some experience with that- the MFC already provide a document model that is
ready to use. For KDE and <idx/Qt/ applications, things are a bit different. <idx/Qt/ is a powerful toolkit as it provides the most needed classes,
widgets etc. But there wasn't any intention to take care of the document-view model, and as KDE is inheriting <idx/Qt/, there weren't any
tendencies to introduce such a model either. This somehow has its reason in the fact that usually X-applications don't work with an MDI
(Multiple Document Interface).  Each main window is responsible for its data and that reduces the need of a document model to the fact
that methods to work on documents are always implied into widgets. The only exception from this currently is the <em/KOffice/ project
that is intended to provide a complete office suite of applications like a word processor, a spreadsheet etc. Technically, this is
realized by two changes two the normal usage of <idx/Qt/ and KDE:

<itemize>
<item>KOffice uses KOM and the free MICO implementation of CORBA for object communication,
<item>the KOffice applications use a document-view model to allow all applications to work with any KOffice data objects
</itemize>

But as KDevelop currently targets on using the current libraries of KDE 1.1.x and <idx/Qt/ 1.4x, we can't use this model by default-
this will come in further releases of a KDE 2, which will (hopefully) contain two new major changes in relation to the current
situation:
<enum>
<item>an MDI interface for <cdx/KTMainWindow/
<item>the KOM libraries that provide a document model
</enum>

Therefore, the current way for application developers can be to either implement all needed document methods within their view or to
try to reproduce a document model by themselves. KDevelop therefore contains such a reproduction by providing the needed classes and
the basic methods that are generally used for a Document-View model with the application frameworks for <idx/Qt/ and KDE.

Back to the code, you now can imagine the purpose of the two methods we mentioned at the beginning of this section: the
<tt/initDocument()/ and <tt/initView()/ functions. The <tt/initDocument()/ constructs the document object that represents the
application window data and initializes the basic attributes like setting the modification bit that indicates if the data currently
used has been changed by the user. Then, the <tt/initView()/ method constructs the <tt/*View/ widget, connects it to the document and
calls the <tt/setView()/ method of <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow// to tell the <tt/*App/ window to use the <tt/*View/ widget as it's center view.

For the developer, it is important to know that during the development process he has to:

<itemize>
<item>re-implement the virtual methods for mouse and keyboard events provided by <tt/<cdx/QWidget// in the <tt/*View/ object to provide the
means to manipulate data,
<item>re implement the <tt/paintEvent()/ of <tt/<cdx/QWidget// in the <tt/*View/ object to repaint() the view after changes,
<item>complete the implementation for printing the document via the printing method of the <tt/*View/ object,
<item>add the serialization for the <tt/*Doc/ object to provide file loading and saving,
<item>add the document data structure implementation to the <tt/*Doc/ object that is representing the document data logically in the
memory.
<item>add any methods that have to be accessible by the user via accelerator<nidx/accelerator/ keys and menus/<idx/toolbar/s.
</itemize>


<sect2>Application Configuration
<p>
Now, after we created all instances of the <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow// instance of our application to create the first window, we have to
initialize certain values that influence the look of the program. For this, we call <tt/readOptions()/, which gets all values and calls
the methods needed to set the according attributes. The KDE-Core library contains the class <tt/<cdx/KConfig// that provides a good
possibility to store values in configuration files as well as to read them in again. Also, as each <tt/<cdx/KApplication// instance creates
it's resource file already, we only have to access this file and create our values. As <tt/<cdx/KConfig// provides us the file object, we
have to use the class <tt/<cdx/KConfigBase// to read and write all entries. As writing is very easy to do with <tt/writeEntry()/ methods,
reading depends on the attribute type which we want to initialize. Generally, an entry in the configuration file contains a value name
and a value. Values that belong together in some context can be collected in groups, therefore we have to set the group name before we
access the value afterwards; the group has to be set only once for reading a set of attributes that are in the same group.

Let's have a look at what we want to read in:
<tscreen><code>
1   void KScribbleApp::readOptions()
2   {
3
4      config->setGroup("General Options");
5
6      // bar status settings
7      bool bViewToolbar = config->readBoolEntry("Show Toolbar", true);
8      view_menu->setItemChecked(ID_VIEW_TOOLBAR, bViewToolbar);
9      if(!bViewToolbar)
10       enableToolBar(KToolBar::Hide);
11
12     bool bViewStatusbar = config->readBoolEntry("Show Statusbar", true);
13     view_menu->setItemChecked(ID_VIEW_STATUSBAR, bViewStatusbar);
14     if(!bViewStatusbar)
15       enableStatusBar(KStatusBar::Hide);
16
17     // bar position settings
18     KMenuBar::menuPosition menu_bar_pos;
19     menu_bar_pos=(KMenuBar::menuPosition)config->readNumEntry("MenuBar Position", KMenuBar::Top);
20
21     KToolBar::BarPosition tool_bar_pos;
22     tool_bar_pos=(KToolBar::BarPosition)config->readNumEntry("ToolBar Position", KToolBar::Top);
23
24     menuBar()->setMenuBarPos(menu_bar_pos);
25     toolBar()->setBarPos(tool_bar_pos);
26
27     // initialize the recent file list
28     recent_files.setAutoDelete(TRUE);
29     config->readListEntry("Recent Files",recent_files);
30
31     uint i;
32     for ( i =0 ; i < recent_files.count(); i++){
33       recent_files_menu->insertItem(recent_files.at(i));
34     }
35
36     QSize size=config->readSizeEntry("Geometry");
37     if(!size.isEmpty())
38       resize(size);
39   }
</code></tscreen>

As we have seen in one of the above code parts, the first action our constructor does was:

<tscreen><verb>
config=kapp->getConfig();
</verb></tscreen>

which sets the <tt/<cdx/KConfig// pointer <tt/config/ to the application configuration. Therefore, we don't have to care for the location of
the configuration file. Indeed, the file is, according to the KDE File System Standard (KDE FSS), located in
<tt>&dollar;HOME/.kde/share/config/</tt>; we will have a closer look about the KDE FSS in a later step when we're setting installation
locations for project files. As the config file is placed in the user's home directory, each user has it's own appearance of his
application except for values that are located in a system wide configuration file that can optionally be created and installed by the
programmer in the KDE directory. But, although this could help in some cases, we should avoid any dependency of our application towards
the existing of file entries. Therefore, all read methods provided by <tt/<cdx/KConfigBase// allow to add a default value to be used when the
entry doesn't exist. Another thing important to a programmer is that the configuration file is stored in plain text, and this is for
some reasons as well as you have to watch some criteria:
<itemize>
<item>the user is able change the configuration file by a plain text editor
<item>if the user wants to change values by hand, the entries should be very transparent to determine their purpose
<item>for entries that have to be saved, but are critical in terms of security like passwords, you have to look for a proper solution
to ensure the security.
</itemize>
Now that we know the basics, we're going to analyze the code. As said, we only have to use our config pointer
to access the values. First, in line 4, we set the current group to "General Options". This indicates that the values used are somewhat
general attributes for the application. Then we read the values for the <idx/toolbar/ and statusbar- these have to be saved when the
application closes to restore their status again when the user restarts the program. As the bars can only be on or off, we use a
boolean value, therefore, our method is <tt/readBoolEntry()/. The process is identical for both bars, so we only have a look at the
lines 7-10 to watch what's happening for the <idx/toolbar/. First, we read the value into the temporary variable <tt/bViewToolbar/ at line 7.
The value name in the file is "Show Toolbar" and, if the value is not present (which would be the case the first time the application
starts), the default value is set to <tt/true/. Next, we set the checkmark for the menuentry for en-/disabling the <idx/toolbar/ by this
value: we call <tt/setItemChecked()/ on the view menu, entry <tt/ID_VIEW_TOOLBAR/ with our attribute. Finally, we set the <idx/toolbar/ to use
the value. By default, the <idx/toolbar/ is visible, therefore, we only have to do something if <tt/bViewToolbar/ is <tt/false/. With
<tt/enableToolBar()/ (line 10) we're setting the bar to hide itself if it is disabled.

Next, we have to read the bar positions. As the user might have changed the bar position by dragging a bar with the mouse to
another view area, these have to be saved as well and their status restored. Looking at the classes <tt/<cdx/KToolBar// and <tt/<cdx/KMenuBar//,
we see that the bar positions can be:
<tscreen><verb>
enum BarPosition {Top, Left, Bottom, Right, Floating, Flat}
</verb></tscreen>
As this value has been written in a numeric value, we have to read it with <tt/readNumEntry()/ and convert it to a position value. With
<tt/setMenuBarPos()/ and <tt/setBarPos()/ we tell the bars where to show up.

Now you probably have noticed that our "File" menu contains a menu for recently used files. The filenames are stored in a list of
strings, which has to be saved on application closing and now has to be read in to restore the menu. First, we initialize the list
with the entries stored by using the <tt/readListEntry()/. Then, in a <tt/for-/loop, we create a menu entry for each list item.

Finally, we only have to take care for the geometry of our window. We read in the appearance by a <tt/QSize/ variable containing an x
and y value for width and height of the window. As the window is initialized by <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow//, we don't have to take care for a
default value and only will use <tt/resize()/ if the entry is not empty.

What is left to explain on application construction is that we initially have to disable available user commands that shouldn't be
available if some instances don't match the needed criteria. These are file saving and operations that are using the clipboard. During
the application's lifetime, we have to take care of these several times, but which is quite easy. The framework only gives us two
methods to enable/disable menubar and <idx/toolbar/ items with one method call at the same time.

<sect2>Executing
<p>
During the past section, we have only monitored what happens during the constructor call of our <tt/KScribbleApp/ instance providing us
the main window. After returning to the <tt/main()/ function, we have to call <tt/show()/ to display the window. What is different from
any <tt/<cdx/KApplication// or <tt/<cdx/QApplication// here is that when we're using <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow// as the instance for our
main widget, we don't have to set it with <tt/setMainWidget()/. This is done by <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow// itself and we don't have to
take care of that.
The only thing left then is to interpret the command-line. We get the command-line option and ask, if <tt/int argc/ is > 1, which
indicates that the user called our application with <tt/kscribble filename_to_open/. Our window is then asked to open the file by it's
name and calls <tt/openDocumentFile()/ with the filename.

The last line of the <tt/main()/ function does the known job: it executes the application instance and the program enters the event
loop.

Now, in section <ref id="The main() Function" name="The main() Function">, we started to separate the execution process by
<tt/if( app.isRestored() )/ and described the usual invocation process. The following now gives an introduction to session
management and how our application makes use of this.

<sect1>Invocation by Session Management
<p>
As we said, the <tt/main()/ function tests, if the application is invoked by the session manager. The session manager is responsible to
save the current status of all open application windows on the user's desktop and has to restore them when the user logs in the next
time, which means that the application is not started by the user but automatically invoked. The part of the code which is executed
was:
<tscreen><verb>
6    if (app.isRestored())
7    {
8       RESTORE(KScribbleApp);
9    }
</verb></tscreen>

In <ref id="The main() Function" name="The main() Function">, we stated that we test the invocation by asking
<tt/app.isRestored()/. Then line 8 gets executed. It looks like a simple statement, but in fact this will result in a complex execution
process which we want to follow in this section.

RESTORE() itself is a macro provided by <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow//. It expands to the following code:

<tscreen><verb>
if (app.isRestored()){
  int n = 1;
  while (KTMainWindow::canBeRestored(n)){
    (new KScribbleApp)->restore(n);
    n++;
  }
}
</verb></tscreen>

This will restore all application windows of the class <tt/KScribbleApp/ by creating the instances and calling <tt/restore()/ to the
new window. It is important to realize that if your application uses several different widgets that inherit <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow//, you have
to expand the macro and determine the type of the top widgets by using <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow/::classNameOfToplevel(n)/ instead of the class
<tt/KScribbleApp/.
The <tt/restore()/ method then reads the part of the session file that contains the information about the window. As <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow//
stores all of this for us, we don't have to care for anything else. Only information that belong to our specific instance of
<tt/KScribbleApp/ has to be found then. Usually this would be a temporary file that we created to store the document or other
initialization that we might need. To get to this restoration information, we only have to overwrite two virtual methods of
<tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow//, <tt/saveProperties()/ and <tt/readProperties()/. The information we have to save on session end is if the currently
opened document is modified or not and the filename. If the file is modified, we will get a temporary filename to save it to. On
session beginning, this information now is used to restore the document contents:

<tscreen><verb>
void KScribbleApp::readProperties(KConfig*)
{
  QString filename = config->readEntry("filename","");
  bool modified = config->readBoolEntry("modified",false);
  if( modified ){
    bool b_canRecover;
    QString tempname = kapp->checkRecoverFile(filename,b_canRecover);

    if(b_canRecover){
      doc->openDocument(tempname);
      doc->setModified();
      QFileInfo info(filename);
      doc->pathName(info.absFilePath());
      doc->title(info.fileName());
      QFile::remove(tempname);
    }
  }
  else if(!filename.isEmpty()){
  doc->openDocument(filename);
  }
  setCaption(kapp->appName()+": "+doc->getTitle());
}		
</verb></tscreen>
Here, the line <tt/kapp->checkRecoverFile()/ seems a bit strange, as <tt/b_canRecover/ is not initialized. This is done by the method
which sets it to <tt/true/, if there is a recover file. As we only saved a document in a recover file if it was modified, we set the
modified bit directly to indicate that the information hasn't been saved to the belonging file. Also we have to take care that the
recover file has another filename than the original file which was opened. Therefore, we have to reset the filename and path to the old
filename. Finally, we have the information we wanted to recover and we can delete the temporary file by the session manager.

<bf/Summary:/

During this chapter, you got to know how the application starts either by normal user invocation or by the session manager. We went
through the code to learn how the parts of the visual interface of the application are constructed as well as how to initialize
attributes by configuration file entries. Now you can execute the framework application to test these functions and see how the
program window reacts.

<sect>Additional Contents of KDevelop Projects
<p>
Besides the source code provided, KDevelop projects contain a lot of other additional parts that are of interest to the developer. These
are:
<itemize>
<item>a program icon
<item>a program mini-icon
<item>a <idx/.kdelnk/ file
<item>a sample <idx/SGML/-documentation file
<item>a set of <idx/API/-documentation generated from the framework source
</itemize>

Except the <idx/API/-documentation, these elements of the project will be installed together with the application binary. As the project
framework has to be as open as possible, you have to adapt these parts towards your project goals. These are first to edit the icons
provided. This will give your application a unique identifier by which the user can determine your application visually in window
manager menus. The <idx/.kdelnk/ file then is a file that installs your application into <tt/kpanel/ in the <tt/Applications/ menu. This has
to be edited by setting the installation path which will be discussed later in this handbook. Finally, the documentation that you will
provide to the user is written in <idx/SGML/. This makes it very easy to create several different output from the same source. By default,
KDevelop offers to create a set of HTML files from this source, for KDE-projects this will automatically use the <tt/<idx/ksgml2html//
program to add a consistent KDE look and feel to the documentation. In a later section, we will see how the <idx/SGML/ source is edited and
what we have to watch for installation on the end-user.

Finally, the <idx/API/ (Application Programming Interface) documentation allows you and other developers to quickly get into the code and use
the classes without having to guess what purpose each class is for. We will learn how to extend the <idx/API/ documentation in a later step,
for now it lasts to know that the documentation is generated by the <tt/<idx/KDoc// program, which processes the header files and creates the
HTML output, therefore all documentation is placed in the headers.

<chapt>Application View Design
<p>
When developing an application with a graphical user interface, the main work takes place in providing a so-called "view" for the
application. A view generally is a widget that displays the data of a document and provides methods to manipulate the document
contents. This can be done by the user via the events he emits by the keyboard or the mouse; more complex operations are often
processed by <idx/toolbar/s and menubars which interact with the view and the document. The statusbar then provides information about the
document, view or application status. As an example, we look at how an editor is constructed and where we can find which part.

An editor generally is supposed to provide an interface to view and/or change the contents of a text document for the user. If you
start <em/KEdit/, you see the visual interface as the following:

<itemize>
<item>The menubar: providing complex operations as well as opening, saving and closing files and exiting the application.
<item>The <idx/toolbar/: offers icons which allow quicker access for most needed functions,
<item>The statusbar: displays the status of the cursor position by the current row and column,
<item>The view in the center of the window, displaying a document and offering a cursor connected to the keyboard and the mouse
to operate on the data.
</itemize>

Now it's easy to understand, that a view is the most unique part of the application and the design of the view decides about the
usability and acceptability of an application. This means that one of the first steps in development is to determine the purpose of the
application and what kind of view design would match best to allow any user to work with the application with a minimum of work
learning how to handle the user interface.

For some purposes like text editing and displaying HTML files, views are provided by the <idx/Qt/ and <idx/KDE libraries/; we will discuss certain
aspects of these high-level widgets in the next section. But for most applications new widgets have to be designed and implemented. It
is that what makes a programmer also a designer and where his abilities on creativity are asked. Nevertheless, you should watch for
intuitivity first. Remember that a lot of users won't accept an application that isn't

<itemize>
<item>graphically nice,
<item>offering a lot of features,
<item>easy to handle,
<item>fast to learn how to use it.
</itemize>
Needless to say that stability is a major design goal. Nobody can prevent bugs, but a minimum can be reached at least by clever design
goals and wide use of object-oriented design. C++ makes programming a joy if you know how to exploit it's capabilities- inheritance,
information hiding and reusablitity of already existing code.

When creating a KDE or <idx/Qt/ project, you always have to have a view that inherits <tt/<cdx/QWidget//, either by direct inheritance or because
the library widget you want to use inherits <tt/<cdx/QWidget//. Therefore, the Application Wizard already constructed a view that is an
instance of a class <tt/&lt;yourapp&gt;View/, which inherits <tt/<cdx/QWidget// already. The application creates your view in the method
<tt/initView()/, where an instance is created and connected to the main widget as it's view with <tt/KTMainWidget::setView()/.

This chapter therefore describes how to use library widgets for creating views of KDE or <idx/Qt/ applications that are generated with
KDevelop, then we're looking at the libraries and what kind of views are already offered.

<sect>Using Library Views
<p>
When your application design has been set up, you first should look for already existing code that will make your life a lot easier. A
part of this search is to look for a widget that can be used as a view or at least as a part of it; either directly or by inheritance.
The KDE and <idx/Qt/ libraries already contain a set of widgets that can be used for this purpose. To use them, you have two options:

<enum>
<item> remove the new view class and create an instance of a library widget; then set this as the view,
<item> change the inheritance of the provided view class to the class of the library widget to use.
</enum>

In either way, it is important to know that if the application framework is currently not linked against the library that contains the
widget, the linker will fail. After you decided to use a certain widget, look for the library to link to; then open
"Project"->"Options" from the KDevelop menubar. Switch to the "Linker Options" page and look for the checkmarks indicating the
libraries that are currently used. If the library of your view widget is already checked, you can leave the project options untouched
and start doing the necessary changes due to your choice. If not, and the linker options offer to add the library by a check box,
check it and press "OK" to leave the project options dialog again. In any other case, add the library in the edit line below with the
<tt/-l/ option. For libraries that your application has to search for before preparing the Makefiles by the <tt/configure/ script on
the end-user machine, add the according search macro to the <tt/configure.in/ file located at the root directory of your project and
add the macro to the edit line. Mind that you have to run "Build"->"Autoconf and automake" and "Build"->"Configure" before the
Makefiles contain the correct expansion for the library macro.

Also, if the include files for the library to add are not in the current include path (which can be seen by the <tt/-I/ options in the
output window on "Make"), you have to add the path to the Project Options dialog -"Compiler Options" page with the <tt/-I/
option or the according automake macro at the edit line for "Additional Options".

<sect1><idx/Qt/ Views
<p>
Looking at the first page of the <idx/Qt/ online documentation, you will find a link to "Widget Screenshots" where you can have a look at
how the widgets <idx/Qt/ contains look like. These are ready to use and can be combined together to form complex widgets to create
application views or dialogs. In the following, we'll discuss some of these which are very usable for creating application views, but
keep in mind that the <idx/KDE libraries/ sometimes contain other widgets for the same purpose; those will be reviewed in the next section.

Here are a set of hints for what purpose you could use which <idx/Qt/ component:
<enum>
<item>if your view area isn't big enough to display all your data, the user must be enabled to scroll over the document with bars on
the left and bottom of the view. For this, <idx/Qt/ provides the class <tt/QScrollView/, which offers a scrollable child area. As explained,
you could inherit your own widget from <tt/QScrollView/ or use an instance to manage your document's view widget.
<item>to create a ScrollView yourself, inherit the View widget from <tt/<cdx/QWidget// and add vertical and horizontal <tt/QScrollBar/s.
(this is done by KDE`s KHTMLView widget).
<item>for text processing, use <tt/QMultiLineEdit/. This class provides a complete text editor widget that is already capable to cut,
copy and paste text and is managed by a scrollview.
<item>use <tt/QTableView/ to display data that is arranged in a table. As <tt/QTableView/ is managed by scrollbars as well, it offers a
good solution for table calculation applications.
<item>to display two different widgets or two widget instances at the same time, use <tt/QSplitter/. This allows to tile views by
horizontal or vertical dividers. Netscape's Mail window is a good example how this would look like- the main view is separated by a
splitter vertically, the right window then is divided again horizontally.
<item><tt/QListView/ displays information in a list and tree. This is useful for creating file trees or any other hierarchical
information you want to interact with.
</enum>

You see that <idx/Qt/ alone offers a whole set of widgets which are ready to use so you don't have to invent new solutions if these match
your needs. The sideffect when using standard widgets is that users already know how to handle them and only have to concentrate on
the displayed data.

<sect1>KDE Views
<p>
The <idx/KDE libraries/ were invented to make designing applications for the K Desktop Environment easier and capable of more functionality
than what <idx/Qt/ alone is offering. To see what's available, we have a look at the documentation tree in KDevelop. You see that the KDE
libraries start with <tt/kdecore/, which is a base for all <idx/KDE applications/. Then,<tt/kdeui/ offers user interface elements. This is
where we will find some useful things first. For creating new applications, the <tt/kdeui/ library offers:

<enum>
<item><tt/<cdx/KTabListBox//: offers a multi-column list box where the user can change the rows with <idx/drag'n drop/.
<item><tt/<cdx/KTreeList//: inherited from <tt/<cdx/QTableView//, offering a collapsible tree. This could be used instead of
<tt/QListView/.
<item><tt/<cdx/KEdit//: the base classes for the <em/KEdit/ application offered with KDE. This could be used instead of
<tt/<cdx/QMultiLineEdit//.
<item><tt/<cdx/KNewPanner//: manage two child widgets like <tt/<cdx/QSplitter//.
</enum>

The <tt/khtmlw/ library on the other hand offers a complete HTML-interpreting widget that is ready to use. It is scrollable already,
so you don't even have to take care for that. A possible use could be to integrate it as a preview widget for an HTML editor; used by
applications such as KFM, <idx/KDEHelp/ and KDevelop to display HTML files.


<sect>Creating your own Views<label id="Creating your own Views">
<p>
Now that you have a general overview of what is already provided, you may notice that for a lot of purposes already existing widgets
can be used or combined together. KMail is an example as well as KDevelop itself makes use of library view components to display data.

For applications that use a special file format or have to deal with graphics, you are probably forced to create your own view widget
to allow data manipulation. This is realized in our sample by the class <tt/KScribbleView/, already providing a base for a view area.

The inheritance from <tt/<cdx/QWidget// is necessary to overwrite the virtual methods to process user events, this is probably the most work
besides providing popup menus for easier access of certain functions. Also it is likely that you have to implement a set of slots which
can be accessed by <idx/toolbar/ buttons or menu bar commands to connect to as well as methods to manipulate variables such as e.g. a painter
color.

For completeness, we will repeat the necessary methods:

<bf/a) Keyboard events --TAB and Shift-TAB keys:/

changes the keyboard input focus from the current widget to the next widget in the focus order. The focus can be set to widgets by
calling <tt/setFocusPolicy<ncdx/setFocusPolicy()/()/ and process the following event handlers:

<itemize>
<item><tt/virtual void focusInEvent<ncdx/focusInEvent()/ ( <cdx/QFocusEvent/ * )/
<item><tt/virtual void focusOutEvent<ncdx/focusOutEvent()/ ( <cdx/QFocusEvent/ * )/
</itemize>

<bf/b) all other keyboard input:/
<itemize>
<item><tt/virtual void keyPressEvent<ncdx/keyPressEvent()/ ( <cdx/QKeyEvent/ * )/
<item><tt/virtual void keyReleaseEvent<ncdx/keyReleaseEvent()/ ( <cdx/QKeyEvent/ * )/
</itemize>

<bf/c) mouse movements:/
<itemize>
<item><tt/virtual void mouseMoveEvent<ncdx// ( <cdx/QMouseEvent/ * )/
<item><tt/virtual void enterEvent<ncdx/enterEvent()/ ( <cdx/QEvent/ * )/
<item><tt/virtual void leaveEvent<ncdx/leaveEvent()/ ( <cdx/QEvent/ * )/
</itemize>

<bf/d) mouse button actions:/
<itemize>
<item><tt/virtual void mousePressEvent<ncdx/mousePressEvent()/ ( <cdx/QMouseEvent/ * )/
<item><tt/virtual void mouseReleaseEvent<ncdx/mouseReleaseEvent()/ ( <cdx/QMouseEvent/ * )/
<item><tt/virtual void mouseDoubleClickEvent<ncdx/mouseDoubleClickEvent()/ ( <cdx/QMouseEvent/ * )/
</itemize>

<bf/e) window events containing the widget:/
<itemize>
<item><tt/virtual void moveEvent<ncdx/moveEvent()/ ( <cdx/QMoveEvent/ * )/
<item><tt/virtual void resizeEvent<ncdx/resizeEvent()/ ( <cdx/QResizeEvent/ * )/
<item><tt/virtual void closeEvent<ncdx/closeEvent()/ ( <cdx/QCloseEvent/ * )/
</itemize>

When re-implementing these functions, you should watch certain issues to avoid implementation mistakes that will make it almost
impossible to change the widget's behavior afterwards:

<enum>
<item>declare your virtual methods as <bf/virtual/ as well and keep the access to protected. This allows code-reuse by inheritance and
is consistent.
<item>don't hard-code any event-processing which should be made configurable. This counts most for keyboard events which should be
realized with keyboard accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s if any function is called. This even counts for text processing ! (Imagine that a lot of users are
familiar with their favorite editor's behavior. If this is configurable, they can use the behavior they like and are used to)
<item>forward popup menu highlighting signals to the main widget to enable statusbar help
</enum>

<chapt>Configuring Menubars and Toolbars<label id="Configuring Menubars and Toolbars">
<p>
Menubars and <idx/toolbar/s are one of the most important parts of an application to provide methods to work with a document structure. As a
general rule, you should make all functions available by the menubar. Those methods that should not be available at a current stage of
the application process should be disabled.

Further, an application can only contain one menubar, but several <idx/toolbar/s. Toolbars on the other hand should contain only the most
frequently used commands by pixmap icons or provide quick access methods like combos to select values.

<sect>How does it work ?
<p>
Each entry, may it be a menuentry or a <idx/toolbar/ item, has a resource ID which is an integer value. As these values can't be used twice,
those are set by macros, where the numeric values are replaced by a descriptive ID name that can be used in your sources then.

All resource ID's are collected in the file <tt/resource.h/, where you can keep an overview over the used values. Anyway, the compiler
will inform you if you've used a value twice for constructing entries. Also, the resource file should contain all menu accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s by
IDK macro replacements. An example:

<code>
(resource.h)

#define ID_VIEW_TOOLBAR             12010


(kscribble.cpp)

// menu entry Toolbar in the "view" menubar menu
view_menu->insertItem(i18n("&amp;Toolbar"), ID_VIEW_TOOLBAR);

</code>

This inserts the entry Toolbar to the View popup menu of the menubar in the kscribble application. The resource ID's name is held to
contain the menu name and the action's name visible. The ampersand is set in front of the letter that functions as a keyboard
accelerator<nidx/accelerator/ and the entry itself is embraced by the i18n() internationalization macro.

On activating the menu item, the commandCallback() switch is called with the ID number. There, you have to add an according comparator
value with the method you want to execute on activating the menuentry:

<code>
    case ID_VIEW_TOOLBAR:
    	slotViewToolBar();
    	break;
</code>

<comment>Note: you don't have to use the ID system. If no ID is given, the menu gets numbered automatically. The KDevelop framework
uses this as it allows accessing menu and <idx/toolbar/ ID's to create <tt/switch/ statements that select the slot to call on
<tt/activated()/ for menus, <tt/clicked()/ for <idx/toolbar/ buttons. The connection can also be made directly using the provided methods of
the classes providing menus and <idx/toolbar/s.</comment>

<sect>Adding a new menu
<p>
A new menubar is added to an application by the following:

<enum>
<item>add a pointer to the new menu in the App-class header
<item>call the constructor of <tt/<cdx/QPopupMenu// to the pointer in <tt/initMenuBar()/ at the location where your menubar should appear
later.
<item>insert the according menu-items into the popup menu and set their resource ID's in the resource file
<item>add connects for <tt/commandCallback()/ and <tt/statusCallback()/ to the menu at the end of <tt/initMenuBar()/
<item>add the methods you want to call by the menu-entries in the header and implementation file.
<item>add the switch statements for the entries to the <tt/commandCallback()/ and <tt/statusCallback()/ methods
</enum>


<sect>Integrating Toolbar buttons
<p>
Toolbar buttons can be added like menu-entries with the difference that the used method is <tt/insertButton()/ and takes a button
pixmap and tool-tip text instead of a menu text.

The icons you want to use can be loaded by <tt/KIconLoader/, where <tt/<cdx/KApplication// offers the macros <tt/ICON()/ and <tt/Icon()/ to
access the icon loader and load the icon. These macros take the filename of the pixmap as their parameter to load the icon from the KDE
file system in a certain order (see <tt/KIconLoader/ for the search order).

The <idx/KDE libraries/ also offer a set of <idx/toolbar/ buttons that can be used for standard actions. In cases where they don't meet your needs,
you will have to paint your own pixmaps. KDevelop supports this by selecting "New" from the "File" menu, then select Pixmap as the file
type. Usually you will place your <idx/toolbar/ pixmaps in a project subdirectory "<idx/toolbar/" and install them into your application specific
<idx/toolbar/ directory.

<sect>Configuring Statusbars
<p>
The KDevelop projects already make use of the statusbar by providing statusbar messages for menu-entries and <idx/toolbar/ buttons. When
adding a menuentry, also add your status message in the method <tt/statusCallback()/.

<tt/statusCallback()/ uses the method <tt/slotStatusHelpMsg()/ to display a statusbar message for two seconds. When executing a
command, you should use the method <tt/slotStatusMsg()/ at the beginning with the string describing what your application does; before
a return or method end, you should reset the statusbar message with a "Ready." string calling the same method.


<sect>Keyboard Accelerator Configuration
<p>
A very professional thing you should always add to your application are keyboard accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s. Those are mainly used by experienced
users that want to work fast with their applications and are willing to learn shortcut<nidx/shortcuts/s. For this, the <idx/KDE libraries/ provide the class
<tt/<cdx/KAccel//, which provides the keyboard accelerator<nidx/accelerator/ keys and access to global configured standard keyboard accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s.

By default, frame applications generated by KDevelop only use standard keyboard accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s such as F1 for accessing online-help,
Ctrl+N for New File etc. You should look for the keyboard accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s already set in <tt/<cdx/KAccel// first before adding a new
accelerator<nidx/accelerator/.

If your application contains a lot of accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s, you should make them configurable by an Options-menu; either it could be combined
with other application configuration in a <tt/<cdx/QWidget// or stand alone. The KDE library already provides a <tt/KKeyChooser/ for use
in tab dialogs, whereas <tt/KKeyDialog/ provides a ready-to use key-configuration dialog.

See the following classes for more information:

<tt/<cdx/KAccel//(<cdx/kdecore/), <tt/<cdx/KKeyChooser//, <tt/<cdx/KKeyDialog// (<cdx/kdeui/)

<chapt>The Dialogeditor: Where your Dialogs are Build
<p>
<sect>What the Dialogeditor provides
<p>
The built-In dialogeditor of KDevelop is designed to help you construct widgets and dialogs that fit your application's purpose and
reduces the time rapidly to extend the GUI of your application. The only limitation for now is that the dialogeditor does not support
geometry management that is provided by <idx/Qt/; therefore the dialogs are static in their size and this may lead to certain circumstances
where e.g. the label width is not long enough to support the full length of a translation.

On the other hand, the current state of the editor in conjunction with KDevelop's project management offers the fastest way to create
full-featured applications for the K Desktop Environment.


<sect><idx/Qt/ and KDE Widgets
<p>
Currently provided widgets are:

<bf/QT-Widgets:/
<itemize>
<item><bf/<cdx/QWidget// - a widget that can be specified by yourself and can contain other widgets as well. This allows creating a widget
hierarchy within your dialog.
<item><bf/<idx/QLabel// - a label that represents text information on the widget. Use <idx/QLabel/ e.g. in front of lineedits to signal what the
purpose of the line-edit is or which variable e.g. a combo box allows to set.
<item><bf/QPushButton/ - a button that allows to e.g. call another dialog like QFileDialog for selecting a filename.
<item><bf/QCheckBox/ - a check box for e.g. enabling/disabling options. QCheckBox is widely used for configuration dialogs.
<item><bf/QLCDNumber/ - displays numbers in LCD style. Often used for clocks.
<item><bf/QRadioButton/ - like QCheckBox often used to let the user set any options. QRadioButton specializes the options setting when more
of them depend on each other, e.g. you have three radio-buttons, but you want the user to choose one of three offered options. See
<tt/<cdx/QButtonGroup// for additional information.
<item><bf/<cdx/QComboBox// - a combo box lets the user set a value by selecting it from a
drop-down menu or by inserting the value, if the box is write enabled.
<item><bf/QListBox/ - provides a single-column list of items that can be scrolled.
<item><bf/QListView/ - creates a multi-column list view that can be used to display e.g. file trees etc. in tree and table view.
<item><bf/QMultiLineEdit/ - offers a multi-line editor.
<item><bf/QProgressBar/ - displays the progress of an action that takes a longer time to be finished.
<item><bf/QSpinBox/ - allows choosing numeric values by up- and down buttons or insertion if write enabled.
<item><bf/QSlider/ - sets a value in a program-defined range by a slider.
<item><bf/QScrollBar/ - indicates the range of a value and sets the current value by a slider as well as up- and down buttons; often
used for widgets whose contents is larger than the actually visible view area. By using the scrollbar, the visible area can be changed
to another part of the widgets' contents.
<item><bf/QGroupBox/ - provides a group box frame with title to indicate that child widgets within the box belong together.
</itemize>

<bf/KDE-Widgets:/
<itemize>
<item><bf/KColorButton/ - a pushbutton displaying a selected color. On a button press, the KDE Color dialog is shown where the user can
select another color. Often used for drawing applications or in any case where color values can be set.
<item><bf/KCombo/ - similar to <tt/<cdx/QComboBox//. Lets the user choose a value by a drop-down list box.
<item><bf/KDatePicker/ - a complete widget to get a date value by the user.
<item><bf/KDateTable/ - a calendar table to select a date of a month. Used by <tt/KDatePicker/ to build the date picker dialog.
<item><bf/KKeyButton/ - a button to select a key value. If the button is selected, it gets activated. Pressing a keyboard button will
change the key value for the button which can be used to configure key-bindings.
<item><bf/KLed/ - and LED (Light Emitting Diode) widget to display a certain state.
<item><bf/KLedLamp/ - and LED lamp that also supports click actions
<item><bf/KProgress/ - similar to <tt/QProgressBar/, <tt/KProgress/ supports certain other values.
<item><bf/KRestrictedLine/ - a <tt/QLineEdit/ that only accepts certain user input. This can be used to restrict access to certain data
by password dialogs.
<item><bf/KSeparator/ - a separator widget to be used in all cases where <idx/KDE applications/ require a separator to provide a unique look.
Often used in dialogs to separate logical parts where <tt/QGroupBox/ doesn't fit.
<item><bf/KTreeList/ - a collapsible list view to display trees similar to <tt/QListView/.
</itemize>

<sect>Properties of <idx/Qt/ supported Widgets
<p>

The following chapter gives a complete overview over the currently supported widgets of the <idx/Qt/ toolkit. To achieve a better
understanding of the properties, these are separated to their inheritance. As all of them inherit <tt/<cdx/QWidget//, this class is described
first. All <tt/<cdx/QWidget// properties are available for all other widgets as well, so these are not listed for them again. For widget groups
that inherit an abstract subclass of <tt/<cdx/QWidget// as their base-class, the base-classes' properties are listed first (though this class does
not provide a widget in the dialogeditor itself). Then the widget properties for the available widget of the group contains the
properties that are specific to it. For a better understanding the inheritance tree of the available widgets is listed below:

<sect>Constructing a new Dialog
<p>
Constructing a new dialog is very easy if you already have experience with graphical construction applications. KDevelop offers to
create a widget visually and displays the look as it will be shown to the user directly. Further, you can have a preview of your widget
by selecting "Preview" from the "View" menu.

To begin constructing a dialog or any other widget, switch to the Dialogeditor and select "New Dialog" from the "File" menu. Then enter
all needed information to the "New Dialog" dialog. Those are:

<enum>
<item>The Dialog inheritance. This is necessary because any widget is at least derived from <tt/<cdx/QWidget//. Besides the widget types
provided by <idx/Qt/, you can inherit e.g. form an abstract base class you constructed yourself within your project. In this case, select
"custom" and enter the header file path to the line edit below.
<item>The Dialog name. This sets the class name of the generated dialog. Select a classname that is descriptive for what the dialog
does; in cases of inheritance from <tt/QDialog/, you may enter a name that ends with <tt/Dlg/ to remember yourself it's a dialog.
Naming convention should match that of KDE and <idx/Qt/: Use uppercase letters for your classname. For e.g. a grid-size selection dialog, you
would enter <tt/GridSizeDlg/.
<item>The generated filenames. Those are preset when entering the dialog name, but can be changed afterwards. If you want to use other
filenames, the naming convention should also match that of KDE and <idx/Qt/: the filenames are all lowercase and contain the classname to
remember what class is kept where. The data file that has to be set will later contain the generated code that will build up your
dialog. You should not edit this file manually afterwards; use the implementation file for any additions towards dialog construction
code and method implementations.
</enum>

The dialog will then show itself as a widget with a grid. As the dialogeditor uses the grid to snap any child widgets to the geometry,
you can change the grid size with the "Grid Size" entry in the "View" menu, if the preset values don't match your needs.

Then select the "Widgets" tabulator on the left pane and press the button for the widget item you want to add to the main widget. It
directly appears on the main widget's left upper corner and gets selected by a resizable frame. Then move or resize the widget with the
mouse. The cursor will change to indicate which action can be done at the current position.

After having finished the construction, select "Generate Files" from the "Build" menu or hit the according <idx/toolbar/ button. The files
will then be generated at the preset location and included into your project sources. A rebuild or make will compile all generated
files within your project and you can add the according constructor call to the application to invoke the dialog or widget. For KDE
projects, all widget properties that will be visible later, e.g. label texts, are set with the <tt/i18n()/ macro of <tt/<cdx/kapp.h// to
support internationalization. Therefore you should do a "Make Messages and merge" when finished with construction and implementation.

When creating a dialog or widget, you should watch the following guidelines:
<itemize>
<item>Always try to be consistent! This is probably the most important rule when constructing GUI elements. Mind that the user will
only accept an application that is easy to understand no matter how complex it's purpose may be.
<item>Add help wherever you can by tool-tips, What's this..? help or Quick-help. This allows getting direct information about the
purpose of the GUI elements.
<item>watch the <bf/<idx/keyboard focus// !  The generator does not take care of that- this has to be watched when constructing any widget;
otherwise you have to reorder your initialization code by hand which is a very unthankful job. The <idx/keyboard focus/ on any widget means
the oder on which items get the keyboard input focus when the user presses the tab and shift+tab button. It would be very annoying if
the focus changes everywhere but not to the next widget visible below or to the right of the current widget. Therefore start
constructing your widget top down from left to right to ensure the consistency of the focus.
</itemize>

<sect>Setting Widget Properties
<p>
<nidx/widget properties/<nidx/dialogeditor/<nidx/properties window/
Widget properties can be set easily with the properties window entries. When a widget gets selected, the properties window
automatically updates to the properties of the current widget. As all widgets are derived from <tt/<cdx/QWidget//, you can set the
<tt/<cdx/QWidget// properties plus an amount of properties that are specific to the selected widget. Properties can be:

<itemize>
<item>Integer values, such as the geometry of a widget or the font size
<item>Boolean values to enable/disable certain parameters of the widget. Set with combos containing true and false
<item>enumerable values of a widget, e.g. the palette. Set with combos containing all possible values
<item>Color values for e.g. the displayed color. Set with the KDE Color Dialog
<item>Font values for e.g. labels. Be careful to set Font values other than the default because this may prevent KDE from updating the
font. Set with the KDE Font Dialog
<item>File names for e.g. background pixmaps. Do not use gif images here as these may get
unsupported by further <idx/Qt/ versions > 1.42
</itemize>

<sect>Integrating the Dialog
<p>
Whenever you created a widget, you probably want to add it to the project to execute the action it is designed for. As a widget can be
constructed for several purposes, we will watch for two cases: a <tt/<cdx/QWidget// inherited widget and a <tt/QDialog/ one.

<sect1><tt/<cdx/QWidget// inherited
<p>
Let's say you created a widget that will be part of the main view. If it fills the whole view area, you have to add an instance pointer
to the header declaration of your <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow// instance replacing the currently set view widget. Then change the code in the
<tt/initView/ method to set this widget the main view. Additionally, you could remove the View class of the generated project, but mind
that the document instance and the App instance depends on the view class. In this case, it is technically a much better way to create
a mini-KDE application and construct your <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow// instance yourself.

More often the widget is intended to be a part of the view area, which means it is combined with other widgets. This can be done by
using one of the following classes that provide a divider to separate two widgets:

<enum>
<item><tt/QSplitter/
<item><tt/KPanner/
<item><tt/KNewPanner/
</enum>

If the main view shall contain more than two widgets, you have to use another instance of the divider as one of the two managed widgets
by the first one. Then add the according widgets to each panner and set the first panner the view area.

<sect1><tt/QDialog/ inherited
<p>
If your widget inherits <tt/QDialog/, it is probably intended to change one or more values; often this is used to set the application
preferences. To invoke the dialog, you have to add a slot to the <tt/App/ class by adding the method declaration and the implementation
body. Then add the constructor call to the method as well as a call to <tt/show()/ or <tt/exec()/ the dialog. Finally, you should take
care for processing the results of the dialog; this can either be done by the dialog who changes values of the parent widget itself or
by retrieving the values from the dialog (which would make your dialog a lot more reusable in other projects). Mind that you should call
<tt/delete/ if you called the dialog instance with <tt/new/ to avoid memory leaks.

Finally, you have to connect a menuentry (with according statusbar help) to the new slot invoking the dialog; optionally a keyboard
accelerator<nidx/accelerator/ and a <idx/toolbar/ icon. For this, add a resource ID to the file <tt/resource.h/ with a define. Then add an according menuentry
to one of the popup menus already present in the menubar or create a new popup to add your menuentry. The menuentry consists of:

<itemize>
<item>an optional icon pixmap. Call this with the <tt/Icon("iconname.xpm")/ macro of <tt/<cdx/KApplication// to use the provided
<tt/KIconLoader/ instance.
<item>the menuentry name. Add this with the <tt/i18n("&amp;entryname")/ macro of <tt/<cdx/KApplication// to allow internationalization. The
ampersand should be in front of the letter that will be displayed underlined to access the entry directly by keyboard acceleration.
<item>the member instance to call. Normally this would be the <tt/this/ pointer.
<item>the member slot to call. Use <tt/SLOT(yourmethod()/ to call the slot on the signal <tt/activated()/.
<item>the accelerator<nidx/accelerator/ key. This should be set to zero as this is done by an entry in <tt/initKeyAccel()/ where you have to introduce an
accelerator<nidx/accelerator/ key together with the slot to call. Then call <tt/changeMenuAccel()/ to change the menu item's accelerator<nidx/accelerator/. This will make
it configurable by a key-chooser dialog later. For standard actions, use the enumerable values given by <tt/<cdx/KAccel//.
<item>the menu ID as set in <tt/resource.h/
</itemize>


<chapt>Printing Support
<p>
<ncdx/QPrinter/<ncdx/QPainter/<ncdx/QPrintdialog/<nidx/printing/
Printing is usually provided by your application to let the user create a printed version of the document he created with the
application; therefore only needed for those programs that are used to produce something the user may want to print out, e.g. text or
pictures. In any case, this requires an interface that is provided by the <idx/Qt/ library by two classes: the <tt/QPrintDialog/ class,
offering the printing dialog, and the <tt/QPainter/ class that is also used to draw the widget's contents usually. As the view-class of
an application is responsible for displaying a document, it also is responsible for printing.

<sect>The <idx/Qt/ Print Dialog
<p>
The <idx/Qt/ Printer dialog can be used including <tt/qprintdialog.h/. When using the KDE framework application, this is already used by the
view class, so you only have to complete the implementation of the method <tt/print()/ by using <tt/QPainter/.

<sect>The QPainter Class
<p>
Independent of the printer's capabilities, you can use <tt/QPainter/ to draw your document onto the printer provided by <tt/QPrinter/
like you would when drawing onto a widget. The only difficulty would be where you have to implement the way things have to be printed.

<chapt>Help Functions
<p>
A very important part of the development process is to provide help functionality to the user wherever possible. Most developers tend
to delay this, but you should remember that a normal user isn't necessarily a Unix-expert. He may come from the the dark side of
computer software usage offering all sweets that a user may need to work himself into using an application even without ever touching
the manuals. Therefore, the KDE and <idx/Qt/ library provide all means usually considered making an application professional in the eyes of
the normal user by help functions that are ready to use. Within the application, those are:

<itemize>
<item>Tool-Tips
<item>Quick-Help
<item>Statusbar help
<item>What's this...? buttons
</itemize>

Additionally, the application should provide means to access a HTML-based online manual directly using the standard help key F1.

As KDevelop also offers all types of help as well as the KDE framework generated by the application wizard already contains support for
this, this chapter will help you find out where and how to add your help functionality.

During the development of your application you should try to be consistent whatever you're doing; therefore you should do the necessary
steps directly while extending the code. This will prevent you from diving into the code again and figuring out what your application
does or what you intended by certain parts of the code.

<sect>Tool-Tips
<p>
A very easy mean of providing help are tool-tips. Those are small help messages popping up while the user moves the mouse over a widget
that provides a tool-tip and disappears when the mouse moves away. The most popular usage of tool-tips is made in <idx/toolbar/s where your
tool-tips should be kept as small as possible because <idx/toolbar/s can be configured to display their contents in various ways: either
displaying the button, button with text on the right, button with text below, text only.  This possibility should be made configurable
by the user, but isn't a must-be. The text is shown as a tool-tip anyway and a <idx/toolbar/ usually consists of buttons and other widgets
like lineedits and combo boxes. For a complete reference, see the <tt/<cdx/KToolBar// class reference located in the KDE-UI library.

As an example, we have a look at the the "New File" button in a generic application:

<tscreen><verb>
toolBar()->insertButton(Icon("filenew.xpm"), ID_FILE_NEW, true, i18n("New File") );
</verb></tscreen>
<ncdx/toolBar()/<nidx/KToolBar/
There, the part <tt/i18n("New File")/ provides a tool-tip message. It is enclosed by the i18n() macro provided by <tt/<cdx/kapp.h// to
translate the tool-tip towards the currently selected language.

Tool-tips can also be added to any custom widget by using the classes <tt/QToolTip/ and <tt/<cdx/QToolTipGroup// provided by <idx/Qt/.
An example of that would be:

<tscreen><verb>
QToolTip::add( yourwidget, i18n("your Tip") );
</verb></tscreen>
For more information, see the <idx/Qt/-Online Reference, class <tt/<cdx/QToolTip//.

<sect>Adding Quick-help
<p>
Quick-Help windows are another good example of providing help. The user can access the quick-help over a widget that it is connected to
by pressing the right mousebutton and selecting "Quick-Help" in the context menu. Therefore, Quick-Help can be placed somewhere in
between a detailed handbook reference help and tool-tips- the documentation would be too extensive and a tool-tip would not provide
enough information. To see how Quick-Help works, open any dialog within KDevelop and press the right mouse button over a dialog item.
Then select the Quick-Help menuentry and you're offered the help message. Additionally, those messages can be formatted by color, font
and even can be used for containing URL's to refer a certain webpage (and therefore can refer to the documentation handbook as well).

To make use of Quick-Help, add the include file <tt/<cdx/kquickhelp.h// to your sourcefile containing quick-help. As the
<tt/<cdx/KQuickHelp// class is part of the KDE-UI library, it should already be used by your application; if not, set the linker flags
of your project to use kdeui.

An example would be:

<tscreen><verb>
KQuickHelp::add( yourwidget, i18n("your Tip") );
</verb></tscreen>

which is almost the same as with QToolTip. When constructing a dialog with the KDevelop dialogeditor, add your tool-tips and Quickhelp
in the implementation file- NOT within the data sourcefile as this is rebuild by the dialogeditor every time you edit the widget.

The <tt/<cdx/KQuickHelp// class provides also formatting text by using tags. It allows hyperlinks including Internet protocols, colors,
font types and sizes. See the <htmlurl url="kde_libref.html" name="KDE Library Reference Guide"> and the <idx/class documentation/ for
<tt/<cdx/KQuickTip// for more information.

<sect>Extending the Statusbar Help
<p>
As the frame applications provided by KDevelop contain a statusbar as well, it also offers a set of statusbar messages already for all
menu and <idx/toolbar/ items. A statusbar help message is a short message that extends the meaning of a tool-tip or can be seen as a
replacement for a tool-tip over menubar items and is (as the name suggests) displayed in the statusbar when the user enters a menu and
highlights the menu entry; therefore all menu items connect their signal <tt/highlighted(int)/ to the method <tt/statusCallback(int)/
which selects the according message in a switch statement. Whenever you add a menuitem to already existing menus or a <idx/toolbar/ item, add
an according entry in this method with a short description of the action the user will cause when activating the button or menuentry.

Example:

<tscreen><verb>
    case ID_FILE_NEW:
 	  	slotStatusHelpMsg(i18n("Creates a new document"));
 	  	break;
</verb></tscreen>

This will display a statusbar message by calling the method <tt/slotStatusHelpMsg()/ with the according translated help string whenever
the user highlights a menu or <idx/toolbar/ item with the id ID_FILE_NEW that is connected to the <tt/statusCallback()/ method.
Toolbars connect to this method by their signal <tt/pressed(int)/, which allows the user to press the <idx/toolbar/ button and move away the
mouse when he doesn't want to invoke the command. <tt/<cdx/KToolBar// also offers the signal <tt/highlighted(int, bool)/ which can be used to
display the message whenever the user highlights the button instead of the preset signal used.


<sect>The "What's This...?" Button
<p>
The <idx/"What's This...?"/ button provides help windows like Quickhelp<nidx/KQuickHelp/, but with the intention that the user wants to
get help about a certain widget within the working view or a <idx/toolbar/ item. It is placed in the <idx/toolbar/ and gets activated
once the user hits the button. The cursor changes to an arrow cursor with a question mark like the button itself looks like. The the
user can press on a visible widget item and gets a help window. As an exercise, you could try this behavior with the What's this...?
button within KDevelop.
To add the What's This...? button, do the following:

<enum>
<item>include <tt/qwhatsthis.h/ into your sourcecode
<item>add a private member <tt/<cdx/QWhatsThis// whats_this/ or with another member name to your <tt/<cdx/KTMainWindow// derived class
declaration <item>define a resource id for your what's this button into the <tt/resource.h/ file,e.g. <tt/#define ID_HELP_WHATS_THIS
10100/
<item>in your method to create the <idx/toolbar/ (usually <tt/initToolBar()/), add at the location you want to have the button
displayed:
<tscreen><verb>
  whats_this = new QWhatsThis;
  QToolButton *btnwhat = whats_this->whatsThisButton(toolBar());
  QToolTip::add(btnwhat, i18n("What's this...?"));
  toolBar()->insertWidget(ID_HELP_WHATS_THIS, btnwhat->sizeHint().width(), btnwhat);
  btnwhat->setFocusPolicy(QWidget::NoFocus);
</verb></tscreen>
<ncdx/setFocusPolicy()/
<item>finally, add the messages you want to have on a click over a certain widget like this:
<tscreen><verb>
whats_this->add(class_tree, i18n("Class Viewer\n\n"
                                  "The class viewer shows all classes, methods and variables "
                                  "of the current project files and allows switching to declarations "
                                  "and implementations. The right button popup-menu allows more specialized "
                                  "functionality."));
</verb></tscreen>
</enum>
	

<chapt>Extending the Documentation with <idx/SGML/
<p>
Due to the fact that projects often lack a complete set of user documentation, all KDevelop projects contain a pre-build handbook that
can be easily adapted; therefore fulfilling another goal of KDE: providing enough online-help to support users that are not familiar
with an application. This chapter therefore introduces you on how to extend the provided documentation template and what you have to do
to make it available to the user.

<sect>Why <idx/SGML/ ?
<p>
<idx/SGML/ (Standard Generalized Markup Language) is a text formatting system that allows to create output in various formats; therefore
technical documentation has to be written only once and can then be transfered to the desired output. The most used output is probably
HTML to provide online help through web-browsers in a time where Internet standards are available even on single-desktop systems. KDE
makes use of HTML documentation by it's <idx/KDEHelp/ application where all <idx/KDE applications/ are listed and give access to their user manuals
as well as by a helpmenu where the user can access the online-help directly from within the application.

To provide a unique look to KDE documentation, the KDE-Software Development Kit (SDK) contains a tool called <tt/<idx/ksgml2html// which
itself uses the sgml-tools' <idx/ksgml2html/ program to extend the HTML output with the KDE logo.

But besides this, sgml-tools allow output in plain text, GNU info, LyX, DVI, Postscript and RTF; therefore the <idx/SGML/
documentation can be easily used to provide a printed version of the online handbook. The KDevelop IDE itself contains four handbooks
that are all written in <idx/SGML/ - you may read this in a printed version or online right now; this alone shows how useful it is to
learn the few things about writing in <idx/SGML/.


<sect>What the Documentation already contains
<p>
When creating a KDevelop project, the subdirectory docs/en already contains the index.sgml documentation file and the already produced
output HTML files. Those are already included into the project as well as their installation destination is preset to the KDE HTML
directory. The documentation is already adapted to your project name, version number and the programmer's information. Further, the
output covers the index.html file containing the table of contents (which is opened by KDE Help when the user requests help); an
installation introduction and a copyright information.

Therefore, when extending the documentation, you only have to concentrate on the information you want to add. Mind that for KDE
projects you have to run "Make Doc-Handbook" from the "Project" menu again after the project is created. The index.sgml file is again
processed by <tt/<idx/ksgml2html// and the logo is added. Then open the RFV and add the <tt/logo.gif/ file to the project and set the file
properties correctly to install the logo file into the same location the HTML files will go.

<sect>Adding new Pages
<p>
Adding another page to the documentation is very easy by adding another &lt;sect&gt;, followed by the name of the chapter to the
index.sgml file at the location where your chapter will appear. For that, search the &lt;sect&gt; that is the chapter before and add
your section after that into the sgml file. Whenever you want to rebuild your documentation output to control for errors, select "Make
Doc-Handbook" from the "Project" menu which will invoke either <idx/ksgml2html/ or <idx/ksgml2html/ depending on the project type. If errors occur,
you are able to locate the error by clicking on the error message or selecting "next error" from the "View" menu.

For each &lt;sect&gt; you added, another HTML output file will be generated; therefore all chapters after the inserted will change
their chapters. This is important if you call your HTML documentation pages from within your application- mind that you have to watch
the page you call for help.

The sgmltools-package contains a reference for almost all valid tags and contains sample code for various formatting purposes. As the
standard <idx/SGML/ file uses the &lt;article&gt; format, you should think about changing to &lt;book&gt; formatting if your documentation
extends more than 10-20 pages in printed form. The KDevelop handbooks have been created this way; the only thing you have to watch out
for is using &lt;chapt&gt; instead of &lt;sect&gt; for chapters. The following subsections then have to be declared with &lt;sect&gt;,
&lt;sect1&gt; etc. as usual.


<sect>How to call Help in Dialogs
<p><nidx/help functions/
Calling help in dialogs is often done by adding a Help-button; then you add a slot that is called when the button gets pressed. Within
the slot implementation, call


<tscreen><verb>
kapp->invokeHTMLHelp( QString aFilename, QString aTopic );
</verb></tscreen>

where <tt/aFilename/ is the the filename to be called within your HTML documentation directory of the application; e.g index-3.html.
<tt/aTopic/ then is the topic that is to be called. The hash prefix is automatically added; just enter the chapter you want to have on
this page, actually this would be a subsection's name.

<chapt>Class Documentation with <idx/KDoc/
<p>
Another important part of the documentation is including a descriptive help for your class interfaces. This will allow you and other
programmers to use your classes by reading the HTML <idx/class documentation/ that can be created with <tt/<idx/KDoc//. KDevelop supports the use
of <tt/<idx/KDoc// completely by creating the KDE-library documentation, also your application frameworks are already documented. To work
yourself into the provided code, it would be a good start to read the included documentation online. The following describes what to do
to get the <idx/API/ documentation, where KDevelop helps you add it and what kind of special tags <tt/<idx/KDoc// provides additionally.

<sect>How to use KDevelop's Documentation features
<p>
To create the <idx/API/ documentation after you generated a project, select "Make <idx/API/-Doc" from the "Project" menu. This will process all
header files and create the HTML output. Then you can access the documentation by selecting "<idx/API/-Documentation" from the Help-menu or
the according book symbol in the Documentation tree, folder "Current Project".

The documentation is already cross-referenced to the KDE and <idx/Qt/ online-<idx/class documentation/, so you can follow the inheritance easily
with the inheritance overview. This may help you getting started with the KDE and <idx/Qt/ documentation as well.


<sect>Adding Class and Member Documentation
<p>
As KDevelop provides all means to add code automatically, it also offers direct documentation. Whenever you're using the Class
Generator by choosing "Project"->"New Class", add a descriptive help message to the documentation field. This will add the
documentation to the class header.

When adding class member functions and attributes with the <idx/classtools/, add the member documentation to the according documentation
fields as well.

You may think that documentation is a part of the development process that isn't very necessary. But remember that the more your
project grows and the more people take part on the development process, <idx/class documentation/ is the best help to save time. If
developers have to guess by method names what exactly the method does, it is even more likely that the meaning is misunderstood and the
method apparently doesn't do the job a developer guessed it would do. Therefore keep track of your documentation and rebuild it as
often as possible.

Besides this, the documentation files are NOT included into the project, nor do they have any internationalization support. Therefore
all <idx/API/ documentation should be held in English to allow international development groups to work with your sources.

Whenever you may want to add documentation by hand into the header file, just add the documentation <bf/above/ the method or class in a
C-comment style with the difference that the first line has to begin with a slash and a double asterisk.

Example:

<tscreen><verb>
  /** enables menuentries/toolbar items
  	*/
  void enableCommand(int id_);
</verb></tscreen>


<sect>Special Tags
<p>
<bf/NOTE:/ The following documentation of this chapter is taken from the <idx/KDoc/ documentation provided with <idx/KDoc/ by
Sirtaj S. Kang <htmlurl url="mailto:taj@.kde.org" name="taj@.kde.org">), author of <idx/KDoc/; Copyright (c) 1997

The documentation is a mixture of:

<itemize>
<item>Normal text. Paragraphs must be separated by at least one blank line.

<item>text of the form
<code>
&lt;pre&gt;
.....code fragments....
&lt;/pre&gt;
</code>
<item>Various tags of the form:
<tscreen><verb>
@tagname [tag parameters]
</verb></tscreen>
</itemize>


The valid tags for each type of source code entity are:

<itemize>
<item>Classes
<tscreen><verb>
  @short [one sentence of text]
    A short description of the class
  @author [one sentence of text]
    Class author
  @version [once sentence of text]
    Class version (I normally set this to the RCS/CVS tag "Id")
  @see [one or more references to classes or methods] 	
    References to other related documentation.
</verb></tscreen>

<item>Methods

<tscreen><verb>
  @see
    as above
  @return [one sentence]
    A sentence describing the return value
  @param [param name identifier] [param description]
    Describe a parameter. The param description can span multiple
    lines and will be terminated by a blank line, the end of the
    comment, or another param entry. For this reason, param entries
    should normally be the last part of the doc comment.
</verb></tscreen>

<item>Constants, Enums, Properties
<tscreen><verb>
  @see
    as above
</verb></tscreen>
<item>ALSO <tt/@ref/
		As a departure from the javadoc format, the metatag "@ref" has the same format as @see, but can appear anywhere in the documentation
(all other tags must appear on a line by themselves).
</itemize>

<chapt>Internationalization
<p>
<sect>What is i18n ?
<p>
i18n is an internationalization system that is used to offer internationalized versions of an application or project. The difficulty
with writing applications is that they only support the language they originally are composed with; visually this can be seen on
labels, menu entries and the like. Goal of the internationalization is to provide applications and library functions in the language of
the user; therefore enabling users that are not capable of the original language to make use of the provided functionality and feel
more comfortable.

<sect>How KDE supports Internationalization
<p>
KDE, as one of the most modern desktop environments, has set one of its numerous goals to provide applications for users in their
native languages, and simplifies the work for developers to provide their application in any of the supported language.

Technically, this is realized by the <idx/KDE File System/ Standard which contains localization support for languages in terms of
documentation and by providing application internationalization through the use of the KDE-core library class <tt/KLocale/. This class
does all the translation, dependent on the preferred language set in the KDE Control Center.

The developer on the other hand only has to know two things to make his application able to use this feature:

<enum>
<item>include <tt/<cdx/kapp.h// into your sourcecode wherever a visible text appears in your application, e.g. in source files that contain
<idx/QLabel/s.
<item>wherever you set the visual string, embrace it with the <tt/i18n()/ macro provided by <tt/<cdx/kapp.h// to enable translation.
<item>whenever you have to access a locale object, use the <tt/klocale/ macro provided by <tt/<cdx/kapp.h//
</enum>

That is almost all you have to watch for while coding. Mind that you should not internationalize any configuration strings that are
used by <tt/<cdx/KConfig//, because this is not necessary on one hand and doesn't work for reading in values on the other.

<sect>Adding a Language to your Project
<p>
KDevelop also takes part on making life easier for developers to include native language support to their applications. Whenever you
create a new KDE project, a <tt/po/ directory is added to the main project directory. There, your <em/&lt;application&gt;/.pot file
will be placed after the generation is complete. The .pot file already contains all strings that are set up with the i18n() macro,
therefore you only have to write your code using the macro again. From time to time, you should do a "Project"-"Make messages and
merge", which will automatically extract all macros again and rebuilds the potfile.
<nidx/"Project"-menu/<nidx/PO-files/<nidx/translations/<ncdx/KLocale/

To add a language to your application, choose "Project"-"Add translation file", which opens the language selection dialog. Select the
desired language and press OK. Then, the according <em/&lt;lang&gt;/.po file will be build in the <tt/po/ directory. Then start
translating the po file by selecting it from the po directory in the Real File Viewer or from the LFV, folder "Translations". If you
have <idx/KTranslator/ installed, it will be opened in the "Tools" window with <idx/KTranslator/, otherwise as a text file in the header/resource
window.
<idx/KTranslator/ makes it very easy to translate strings by scanning the existing translations of your local KDE installation, so they can
be used already.

For editing by hand, we'll have a look at an example:
<tscreen><verb>
#: kscribble.cpp:619
msgid "Opens an existing document"
msgstr ""
</verb></tscreen>

The above shows a string that was extracted from the file <tt/kscribble.cpp/ at line 619. <tt/<cdx/msgid// and <tt/<cdx/msgstr// are the tags which
give the information for the translation; <tt/<cdx/msgstr// will contain the translated string. There, you have to watch escape sequences
such as \n or \t, which have to be included into the translation string. A German translation would therefore look like this:

<tscreen><verb>
#: kscribble.cpp:619
msgid "Opens an existing document"
msgstr "ffnet ein existierendes Dokument"
</verb></tscreen>

That would be all to watch for translation; after you're done, save the file. When make is run within the po directory, the message
files will be processed and errors may occur if strings are not translated consistently, e.g. escape sequences are missing. Then edit
the according message string again and make sure that make runs without errors.

Additionally, you should be very careful when translating ampersands within text strings. The letters after ampersands are used as
keyboard accelerator<nidx/accelerator/s in conjunction with the ALT key to access menubar or popup menu items to change the <idx/keyboard focus/ to the
selected item more quickly. Now, if the same accelerator<nidx/accelerator/ letter appears in the same <idx/keyboard focus/ area (which would be the main widget
on one time, and a dialog at another), each widget after the first one cannot be accessed by the supposed keyboard accelerator<nidx/accelerator/. So even
translators have a responsibility for the usage of the application under their language. There is also no guarantee that the original
letter will occur in the translation, so translators have to choose very carefully and should test the application under their language
after they installed the translation to ensure it runs without these malfunctions.

<sect>Translation Team Contacts
<p>
The KDE Team also provides numerous contacts to developers that are contributing to the KDE project as translators. Those are organized
in language teams and coordinate the translation work.
For an actual list and information who to ask for translating your application, see <url url="http://www.kde.org">.

The information below is taken from the KDE web site and contains the current contact addresses as of March 06, 1999. If you want to join
a team please write directly to one of the team coordinators.

The translation of the KDE is organized by Juraj Bednar <htmlurl url="mailto:bednar@rak.isternet.sk"
name="mailto:bednar@rak.isternet.sk"> and Matthias Elter <htmlurl url="mailto:me@kde.org" name="me@kde.org">

<p><nidx/debugging macros/
<sect>Debugging Macros provided by <idx/Qt/
<p>
The Debugging Macros provided by the <idx/Qt/ library can be read on the debug.html page of your <idx/Qt/ Online Reference
Documentation, acessable on the link "Debugging Techniques" at the <idx/Qt/ Documentation index page.

The most recently used macros are

<itemize>
<item>ASSERT(b)
<item>CHECK_PTR(p)
</itemize>

Thereby, b is a boolean expression. Gives out a debugging warning if b is false; p is a pointer which is checked and gives out a
warning, if p is null.

Details can be found in the <idx/Qt/ Online Reference.

<sect>KDE Macros
<p>
<bf/NOTE:/ This chapter is a copy of Kalle Dalheimer's <htmlurl url="mailto:kalle@kde.org" name="kalle@kde.org"> explanation document
about the <idx/KDEBUG/ macros included with the KDE libs package as kdebug.html

Last modified: Sat Sep 13 11:56:01 CEST 1997


<bf/What is KDebug/

KDebug is a system of macros and functions that makes using diagnostic messages in your code more efficient. You can give a message
one out of four severity level and an area. You can choose at runtime where diagnostic messages should go and which of them should be
printed at all. How to use KDebug in your code

<bf/The macro <idx/KDEBUG//

Using KDebug is very simple. All you have to do is to #include &lt;kdebug.h&gt; at the beginning of every source file in which you want
to use diagnostic messages and output the messages by calling the macro <idx/KDEBUG/. This macro expects three parameters. The first is the
severity level. Use one of the following constants:

<itemize>
<item><idx/KDEBUG_INFO/
<item><idx/KDEBUG_WARN/
<item><idx/KDEBUG_ERROR/
<item><idx/KDEBUG_FATAL/
</itemize>

The second parameter is the area. An area is a part of KDE that you define yourself. You can then at runtime choose from which areas
diagnostic messages should be printed. Please see the file kdelibs/kdecore/kdebugareas.txt for a list of already allocated area ranges.
Choose an area within the range allocated for your application. If your application is not yet in here and you have CVS access, you can
allocate a range for your application here, otherwise just mail me. It is probably a good idea to define symbolic constants for the
areas you want to use, but this is completely up to you. The third parameter, finally, is the text you want to output. KDebug
automatically prepends the logical application name if you output to a file, to stderr or to syslog. A newline is always appended, you
need not (and should not) use one yourself. If you need parameters, you can use one of the macros KDEBUG1, ..., KDEBUG9. These allow
for one to nine additional arguments. The syntax is exactly the same as with printf, i.e. you have to include format specifiers in your
message which get replaced by the additional parameters. An example:

<tscreen><code>
KDEBUG3( <idx/KDEBUG_INFO/, kmail_composer, "Message no. %d to %s has %d bytes",
          message_no, aMessage.to(), aMessage.length() );
</code></tscreen>


<bf/<idx/KASSERT//

There are also the macros KASSERT, KASSERT1, ..., KASSERT9 which work just like their <idx/KDEBUG/-counterparts, except that they have an
additional bool as their first parameter. Only if this evaluates to false will the message be output. Note: You should not use neither
<idx/KDEBUG/ nor <idx/KASSERT/ before the <cdx/KApplication/ object is constructed. Note 2: KDebug provides no means for internationalization because it
is meant strictly for developers only. If you want to inform the user about an erroneous condition (like "this file is not writable"),
use KMsgBox.

<bf/Compiler switches/

You do not need any special compiler switches in order to use KDebug. But when you ship your
product (this mainly applies to people who create distributions like .rpm or .deb packages), you should compile with the switch
-DNDEBUG. This will simply remove all the debugging code from your application and make it smaller and faster (e.g. it uses 256K less
non-shareable memory).


<bf/How to manage diagnostic messages at runtime/

You can press Ctrl-Shift-F12 in every <cdx/KApplication/ at any time, and the "Debug Settings"-Dialog will appear. Here you can define
separately for every severity level what should be done with the diagnostic messages of that level. The following settings are
available:

<itemize>
<item>Output: In this Combobox, you can choose where the messages should be output. The choices are: "File", "Message Box", "Shell"
(meaning stderr) and "syslog". Please do not direct fatal messages to syslog unless you are the system administrator yourself. The
default is "Message Box".
<item>File: This is only meaningful when you have chosen "File" as the output and provides the name of that file (which is interpreted
relatively to the current directory). The default is kdebug.dbg.

<item>Area: The areas which should only be output. Every message that is not mentioned here will simply not be output (unless this
field remains empty which is the default and means that all messages should be output). Your can enter several areas separated by
commas here, and you can also use area ranges with the syntax start-end. Thus a valid entry could be: 117,214-289,356-359,221. Please
do not use whitespace.
</itemize>

Apart from this, you can also tick the checkbox "Abort on fatal errors". In this case, if a diagnostic message with the severity level
"<idx/KDEBUG_FATAL/" is output, the application aborts with a SIGABRT after outputting the message. When you close the dialog with OK, your
entries apply immediately and saved in your application's configuration file. Please note that these settings are specific for one
singular application! When you press cancel, your entries are discarded and the old ones are restored.

<chapt>The KDE File System Standard
<p>
This chapter is a copy of the KDE-File System Standard as published on the KDE website at <url url="http://www.kde.org">, written by
Richard Moore <htmlurl url="rich@kde.org" name="rich@kde.org">

<bf/KDE File System Standard/

This file documents the directory structure that KDE and all KDE compliant applications should use. This is version 0.0.4 of the
standard.

<sect>Introduction
<p>
The purpose of the <idx/KDE FSSTD/ is to ensure that all resources (icons, mimetypes etc.) needed for <idx/KDE applications/ are stored in a
consistent directory structure. Following this structure allows applications to make use of tools such as the KIconLoader class and
allows separation of the platform specific data needed by KDE from platform independent data (making installations on multiple
architectures possible). In this document directory names have been suffixed with a `/` character. Where the word 'appname' appears in
angle brackets &lt;like this&gt; it means that there should be an entry corresponding to every installed KDE application. The word
'lang' is used in the same way to indicate that there should be an entry for every supported language named according to the standard
two letter language codes eg. 'fr' for French, 'de' for German etc.

<sect>Directory Layout
<p>
The KDE directory structure is as shown below, the top of the KDE installation tree is usually '/opt/kde' and can be found at run time
by using the kdedir() method of <cdx/KApplication/ (this replaces the KDEDIR environment variable the use of which is now deprecated). This
document will refer to this directory as kdedir().

<sect>What does this mean to application developers?
<p>
A standard KDE application will install files into several places in the above structure. The only required items are the application
binary, the application kdelnk file, the application icon and the application help files - all others are optional. The most common
things that are installed are:

<tscreen><verb>
Type of file                                      Location

Application binary (required)                     kdedir()/bin/
Application kdelnk file (required)                kdedir()/share/applnk/
Application icon (required)                       kdedir()/share/icons/&lt;appname&gt;.xpm
Application help files (required)                 kdedir()/share/doc/default/HTML/&lt;appname&gt;/&lt;index&gt;.html
Application toolbar pixmaps                       kdedir()/share/apps/&lt;appname&gt;/toolbar/
Application platform independent data             kdedir()/share/apps/&lt;appname&gt;/
Application platform specific data                kdedir()/lib/&lt;appname&gt;/
</verb></tscreen>
<nidx/KDE File System/

<sect>Application Documentation
<p>
I've suggested making putting at least a single page in

kdedir()/doc/default/HTML/&lt;appname&gt;/&lt;appname&gt;.html

a requirement for KDE compliance. The application is free to use the directory to store any help data it requires.


Applications that support more than one language would place the other languages inkdedir()/doc/&lt;lang&gt;/HTML/&lt;appname&gt;/&lt;appname&gt;.html
with there being one 'lang' directory for each language code as usual. Arranging the files like this would allow links between the help
files of two different applications that both support a given language.

I am not 100% happy with the solution I've suggested as it does not allow any way to fall back to the default language if a required
translation is not available.

<sect>What does this mean to library developers?
<p>

<itemize>
<item>kdedir()/share/apps/&lt;libname&gt;/<idx/toolbar/
</itemize>
Toolbar icons for library widgets.

<itemize>
<item>kdedir()/share/apps/&lt;libname&gt;/pics
</itemize>
Any other bitmaps for library widgets.

<chapt>File System Usage for KDevelop Projects
<p>
As the last chapter covered the KDE File System Standard, this chapter deals with what you have to do to use the file system. A KDE
project uses the file system at least for installation routines; therefore we will discuss setting installation properties for your
project files. Your application may make use of files that are installed afterwards, where it is important to know how to get the
relative pathname by the standard. This enables your application to work wherever the KDE file system may be and prevents hard-coding
any file information.

<sect>Accessing Files during Runtime
<p>
After the installation of your project by end-users, your application may require file information during runtime. During the
development process, you will experience at least one error which is caused when running your application within the KDevelop IDE and
requiring the application manual by "Help"-"Contents" or pressing the F1 key. This will result in a message box, saying that the
index.html file could not be found- if you haven't installed your application on your local KDE file system. Your application asks
<idx/KDEHelp/ to open your index page with detecting the installation directory first through <tt/<cdx/KApplication//'s methods to access the file
system, therefore, we will have a look at what <tt/<cdx/KApplication// offers and make some example usage. Also other classes of
<tt/KDE-Core/ make use of the KDE File System like <tt/KIconLoader/ and <tt/KLocale/, which will be reviewed afterwards.

<sect><cdx/KApplication/ Methods
<p>

The <cdx/KApplication/ class offers the following methods to access the KDE File System:
<tscreen><verb>
void invokeHTMLHelp ( QString aFilename, QString aTopic ) const
static const QString& kde_htmldir ()
static const QString& kde_appsdir ()
static const QString& kde_icondir ()
static const QString& kde_datadir ()
static const QString& kde_localedir ()
static const QString& kde_cgidir ()
static const QString& kde_sounddir ()
static const QString& kde_toolbardir ()
static const QString& kde_wallpaperdir ()
static const QString& kde_bindir ()
static const QString& kde_configdir ()
static const QString& kde_mimedir ()
static QString localkdedir ()
static QString localconfigdir ()
static QString findFile ( const char *file )
</verb></tscreen>
<nidx/KDE File System/
The methods are generally used with the <tt/<cdx/KApplication// object of your application, where <tt/<cdx/KApplication// offers the macro
<tt/kapp/ to receive the pointer:

#define kapp <cdx/KApplication/::getKApplication()

Therefore, the methods are generally used like this:
<tscreen><verb>
QString sounddir=kapp->kde_sounddir();
</verb></tscreen>
This example stores the path of the KDE sounddirectory under a <tt/QString/, where you would append e.g. the sound filename. Then you
can process this information and play a sound file that is located there. You should always test for the existence of a file by using
<tt/QFileInfo/'s <tt/exists()/ method.

Within these methods,

<tscreen><verb>
void invokeHTMLHelp( QString aFilename, QString aTopic ) const [public]
</verb></tscreen>

takes a special position to invoke the KDE help. Generally, you should use it everywhere a user needs to access information, e.g. when
he is presented a modal dialog. The F1 key will not work to invoke the help contents, also the user should be presented the according
help page. To make a good use of it, add a "Help" button to your dialog and create a slot that is used to connect on signal
<tt/pressed()/. In this method, use <tt/<cdx/invokeHTMLHelp()// with the according page and subject; in case your application's documentation
isn't written completely yet, leave this open to complete it after the documentation is in sync with the application.

The documentation of <tt/<cdx/KApplication// says:

Invoke the kdehelp HTML help viewer.

Parameters: aTopic
This allows context-sensitive help. Its value will be appended to the filename, prefixed with a "#" (hash) character.

aFilename: The filename that is to be loaded. Its location is computed automatically according to the KFSSTND. If aFilename is empty,
the logical appname with .html appended to it is used.


The methods of  <tt/<cdx/KApplication// will retrieve the following path's.

<tscreen><verb>
kde_htmldir()         kdedir()/share/doc/HTML         Returns the directory where KDE stores
                                                      its HTML documentation

kde_appsdir()         kdedir()/share/applnk           Returns the directory where KDE applications
                                                      store their .kdelnk file

kde_icondir()         kdedir()/share/icons            Returns the directory where KDE icons are stored

kde_datadir()         kdedir()/share/apps             Returns the directory where KDE applications
                                                      store their specific data

kde_localedir()       kdedir()/share/locale           Returns the directory where locale-specific
                                                      information (like translated on-screen messages) are stored

kde_cgidir()          kdedir()/cgi-bin                Returns the directory where cgi scripts are stored

kde_sounddir()        kdedir()/share/sounds           Returns the directory where sound data are stored.
                                                      This directory is for KDE specific sounds.
                                                      Sound data of Applications should go
                                                      into kde_datadir()

kde_toolbardir()      kdedir()/share/toolbar          Returns the directory where toolbar icons are stored

kde_wallpaperdir()    kdedir()/share/wallpapers       Returns the directory where KDE wallpaper files are stored

kde_bindir()          kdedir()/bin                    Returns the directory where KDE application binaries are stored

kde_configdir()       kdedir()/share/config           Returns the directory where config files are stored

kde_mimedir()         kdedir()/share/mimelnk          Returns the directory where mimetypes are stored

localkdedir()         $HOME/.kde                      Get the local KDE base dir

localconfigdir()      $HOME/.kde/share/config         Get the local KDE config dir
</verb></tscreen>

To search for a specific file, use <tt/findFile(const char *file)/ which will search several path's of the KDE File System:

<enum>
<item>$KDEDIR,
<item>$KDEPATH,
<item>"&lsqb;KDE Setup&rsqb;:Path=" entry in a config file.
</enum>

If the file is not found, the QString method isEmpty() will  return True

<sect>KIconLoader Methods
<p>

QPixmap loadIcon ( const QString &amp;name, int w = 0, int h = 0 )

QPixmap reloadIcon ( const QString &amp;name, int w = 0, int h = 0)

QPixmap loadMiniIcon ( const QString &amp;name , int w = 0, int h = 0 )

QPixmap loadApplicationIcon ( const QString &amp;name, int w = 0, int h = 0 )

QPixmap loadApplicationMiniIcon ( const QString &amp;name, int w = 0, int h = 0 )

bool insertDirectory ( int index, const QString &amp;dir_name )


<sect>Setting File Installation Properties
<p>
As the above explained where <idx/KDE applications/ should place their files and how to access them at runtime, the following will explain
how to set the file properties correctly to ensure the files get installed at the right place. The Makefiles support a set of macros to
install your files into the KDE File System and which have to be used for setting the file installation properties.

To set the properties, open your project and select "Project"-"File Properties" which opens the File Properties dialog.
The file properties are displayed if you select a filename currently included in the project. First of all, a file has a type property,
which can be one of the following:

<itemize>
<item><bf/HEADER:/  specifies a file as a header file
<item><bf/SOURCE:/ specifies a file as a source file
<item><bf/SCRIPT:/ specifies a file as a script file
<item><bf/DATA:/ specifies a file as a data file that usually gets installed like pixmaps or HTML documentation files
<item><bf/PO:/ specifies a file as a translation file
<item><bf/KDEV_DIALOG:/ specifies a file as a dialog file to be interpreted by the dialog library
</itemize>

Further, a file is included in the project, if "Include in Distribution" is checked. This ensures that the file is included in the
distribution tarball or package.

If a file has to be installed, you have to enable "Install". This will allow setting the Installation path for the selected file, where
the filename is already inserted.

Now, as said above, the Makefile already is capable of a set of macros for the KDE File System Standard. These are used to set the
installation path and ensure that the files actually will land in the KDE file system and not somewhere else. Macros that can be used,
have to be embraced in round brackets and are marked with the dollar sign in front of the macro. When configure builds the Makefiles on
the end-user's system, it will determine values for these macros that match the real directory name and will expand the Makefile.am
macro towards the actual destination.

When looking a standard KDE application project, you will see on the file property of your <tt/index.html/ file that it already uses a
macro to determine where it should go:

$(kde_htmldir)/en/kscribble/index.html

This says, that make should install the file index.html in the kde-html directory, subdirectory en for English, the application
subdirectory and the filename. You could as well use another filename if you like to rename the file on the installation destination.

For the destination of your binary you currently have to edit the project's Makefile.am if your destination should be different form
the "Applications" section of kpanel:

APPSDIR = $(kde_appsdir)/Applications

Possible values are (as the KDE-File System Standard says):

<itemize>
<item>Applications
<item>Games
<item>Graphics
<item>Internet
<item>Multimedia
<item>Settings
<item>System
<item>Utilities
</itemize>

Setting no directory will end your applnk directly in kpanel's root.

The following list contains the macros that can be used in the installation setup for files:

<tscreen><verb>
kde_htmldir       Where your docs should go to. (contains lang subdirs)
kde_appsdir       Where your application file (.kdelnk) should go to.
kde_icondir       Where your icon should go to.
kde_minidir       Where your mini icon should go to.
kde_datadir       Where you install application data. (Use a subdir)
kde_locale        Where translation files should go to.(contains lang subdirs)
kde_cgidir        Where cgi-bin executables should go to.
kde_confdir       Where config files should go to.
kde_mimedir       Where mimetypes should go to.
kde_toolbardir    Where general toolbar icons should go to.
kde_wallpaperdir  Where general wallpapers should go to.
</verb></tscreen>

Use these macros in conjunction with the according necessary subdirectories and the filename for setting the installation properties.
By default, the currently created HTML documentation files, the kdelnk file, Icon, Miniicon and the translation files (also newly
create ones) are already set up for their destination; therefore you don't have to make any changes for your default installation
routine that has been set up by the application wizard of KDevelop.

<sect>Organizing Project Data
<p>
Another issue in creating projects often appears to the programmer if he has or wants to include additional data that have to be
installed with the project. You already know where to install it, but what about organizing it in the source tree ?

A good advice here may be to collect all data in directories that more or less match the KDE File System Standard, e.g. your
application needs additional <idx/toolbar/ icons. Creating these icons in the main project directory is potentially not a good idea as they
will be difficult to locate in the real file viewer and a removal will result in much work for each icon. Therefore, create your icon
with "File"- "New" and choose a subdirectory <tt/<idx/toolbar//; if it doesn't exist, it can be easily created with the "select directory"
dialog. Existing icons can be copied and included into the project with "Project"-"Add existing file(s)", where you have to choose the
files and the destination. When selecting the destination directory, you can create the <tt/<idx/toolbar// subdirectory first within the
selection dialog. After being finished, press OK and the files will be copied as well as included in the project.

As an example, a <idx/toolbar/ icon should go to the following:

$(kde_datadir)/<em/&lt;appname&gt;//<idx/toolbar//<em/&lt;youricon&gt;/.xpm

Pictures or additional icons that are not used as <idx/toolbar/ icons should go to a subdirectory <em/pics/ instead of <em/<idx/toolbar//.

<sect>The <tt/kdelnk/ File
<p>
The <em/&lt;appname&gt;/<idx/.kdelnk/ file currently included in your project will install itself in KDE's kpanel structure. You should think
it is already created and complete, therefore shouldn't require any further notification. Despite of KDevelop's advanced qualities to
help you with creating, programming and designing applications, it cannot determine the exact purpose of your application- and that is
the information you have to add to the kdelnk file. As this is a text file, select it from the RFV or the LFV; it will be opened in the
Header/Resource window.

The sample kdelnk file would look like this:
<tscreen><verb>
# KDE Config File
&lsqb;KDE Desktop Entry&rsqb;
Type=Application
Exec=kscribble
Icon=kscribble.xpm
DocPath=kscribble/index.html
Comment=
Comment&lsqb;de&rsqb;=
Terminal=0
Name=kscribble
Name&lsqb;de&rsqb;=kscribble
</verb></tscreen>

This already contains the basic configuration for the application specific data such as the icon, binary name, application name etc.
You see that the section Comment is still empty. There you have to insert the Quick-Tip that will be displayed when the mouse cursor
moves over the kdelnk file icon on the desktop or in kpanel. If scribble would be a small drawing program, you would enter e.g.

<tscreen><verb>
Comment=A simple drawing program
</verb></tscreen>

Each comment line afterwards will contain the same description translated in the language the brackets symbolize. Ask translators to
insert a good translation in their native language or include the kdelnk file when asking for translating the application's po file;
the same applies to the name of the application set in the Name lines.
