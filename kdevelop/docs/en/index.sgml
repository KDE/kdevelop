<sect>Introduction<p>
As everything on earth has it's fashions, today's computer world seems to tend more to the use of free software even for
commercial purpose. The most popular software project among thousands is Linux, and it's existence is a proof for the quality that
non-cost products can achieve. But inspite of the quality, end users still suffer under the cryptic use of almost any Unix-like
systems; even the most enthusiastic users seem to only accept such an Operating System besides their commercial products. A major
attempt to make free software even more competitive and to get commercial producers to port their applications to e.g. Linux, is
in the first place to make usability as easy as possible and thereby increase the productivity of the system. The KDE project
tries to close this gap and besides the programs provided with it, the libraries offer a perfect way to extend the variety of
available GUI-based software. But especially as free software is often made in the author's free time, the question for authors is
how much they like their development environment. KDevelop wants to take another major step- making the programmer's life easier
and save time; on the other hand the products created with KDevelop can reach a higher level of reliability and functionality in
the same development period. To fulfill this goal, the KDevelop Integrated Development Environment is capable of many
features that developers need as well as it wraps functionality of third party projects and makes them an invisible, in-cryptic
part of the development process. From within the user interface, you're managing:

<itemize>
<item> all development tools needed for C++ programming like compiler, linker, automake and autoconf,
<item> the KAppWizard, who generates complete applications for various purposes that are ready-to-run,
<item> the Classgenerator, creating new classes and integrating them into the current project,
<item> file properties for sources, headers, documentation etc. to be included in the project and their installation destination
for the end-user,
<item> the creation of User-Handbooks written with SGML and automatic generation of HTML-output with the KDE-look'n feel,
<item> automatic HTML-based API-documentation for your project's classes with cross-references to the used libraries,
<item> internationalization support for your application, allowing translators to easily add their target language to your
project,
<item> WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) -creation of user interfaces with the build-in dialog editor and their automatic
transfer to clean C++ code,
<item> debugging your application by integrating KDbg,
<item> the editing of project-specific pixmaps with KIconedit,
<item> any other program you need for development by adding it to the "Tools"-menu according to your individual needs.
</itemize>

KDevelop makes it a joy to work with all programs in one place and helps saving time by automating standard development processes
as well as giving you direct and transparent access to all information you need. The integrated browsing mechanisms are designed
to support all type of requests that developers have in conjuction with their project. The class viewer brings you anywhere in the
project code by a mouse click without needing to search for files or lines as does the error finder reduces code correction to a
click and your creativity to detect the error cause; file trees give direct access to the project files and the integrated
help system offers the best availability to online-documentations anywhere within the IDE.

<sect1>Changes
<p>
This version of the KDevelop IDE is yet another huge step towards providing an easy to understand environment that fulfills it's
promise towards usability and functionality. Since the last release, we sat down how to extend the design and decided about the
technical realization. Then, the main work was done in three different areas: the class viewer, the dialog editor and the
"look-n'-feel" in general, including new editing functions and the creation of KDE-applications. In order to do that, we were
proud to welcome the newest two team members, Jonas Nordin, who designed a full-featured class parser and -viewer, and Pascal
Krahmer, who joined the team to implement an up-to-date dialog editor running inside KDevelop and interacting with the project
management. Other work was done in various parts of the IDE, such as a new <tt/grep/-dialog allowing expression search through all
project files or even the whole system KDevelop runs on; extended configuration utilities; this reviewed and extended
documentation as well as a new project generator.

<sect1>About this Handbook
<p>

This user manual to the KDevelop IDE gives the user a complete overview of the provided functionality and describes the basic
development process in short, which can be seen as an introduction into C++ application design with KDevelop in general. For more
information about specific programming issues, we advise to read the KDevelop Programming Handbook included with your
distribution of KDevelop, covering themes like understanding generated application frameworks and how to create full-featured KDE
applications by example projects. The design of this handbook is therefore separated into the following parts:

<itemize>
<item>Chapter <ref id="Installation" name="Installation">, covers the system requirements, installation and setting up of the
KDevelop IDE.

<item>Chapter <ref id="Programs" name="Programs">, tells you how programs are created with standard GNU development tools and
how they are build.

<item>Chapter <ref id="Developing with KDevelop" name="Developing with KDevelop">, takes you on a short trip describing the
main functionality of the environment.

<item>Chapter <ref id="Overview" name="Overview">, explains the menus and dialogs as well as keyboard shortcuts.

<item>Chapter <ref id="The Helpsystem" name="The Helpsystem">, shows how to use the build-in documentation browser and
additional help functions.

<item>Chapter  <ref id="Working with the Editor" name="Working with the Editor">, tells you the features of file management and
editing functionality of KDevelop.

<item>Chapter <ref id="Projects" name="Projects">, describes the creation and maintaining of software projects.

<item>Chapter <ref id="The Dialogeditor" name="The Dialogeditor">, features the integrated visual GUI constructor and how it
generates C++ output.

<item>Chapter <ref id="Questions and Answers" name="Questions and Answers">, covers questions that regard to the usage of
KDevelop under different Unices and problem solutions in general.
</itemize>

For programming beginners and new users of this product we recommend to read yourself into this manual before starting to actually
work with the IDE as it covers the usage in depth. The understanding of how things are done the quickest way will save you a lot
of time searching for functions and features as it will enable you to make use of first-class development tools even more simple.

<sect>Installation<label id="Installation">
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain KDevelop
<p>
KDevelop can be found either on the <htmlurl url="http://www.kde.org/current.html" name="KDE Applications page">
or on the <htmlurl url="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html" name="KDevelop homepage">.

There, we offer weekly snapshots of the KDevelop CVS repository for those who want to stay up to date with KDevelop. Usually, the
snapshots are not intended to be used for production but as a test for new features and to give an insight into development
progress of the KDevelop team.

If you're experiencing problems with compiling or using KDevelop, please read the <ref
id="Questions and Answers" name="Questions and Answers"> section of this manual or the FAQ-file included with the KDevelop
package. If your problem is not addressed, please subscribe to the <htmlurl url="mailto:kdevelop@fara3.cs.uni-potsdam.de" name =
"KDevelop mailinglist"> by sending a mail with an empty header and "subscribe" as contents.

Requests and problem report should only target the usage of the KDevelop IDE and not towards any questions that regard any
implementation problem you may have while coding your own application. Anyway, all mails send to the mailinglist should be
written in English, so that all participants can take part on discussions and are able to provide better help.

The mailinglist is also intended for those users willing to contribute and who found solutions for any problems they experienced,
so we can fix errors and include that knowledge to give beginners an even more qualified first-hand help.

An good way to report problems is to send the output you get by starting kdevelop from the console or to copy and paste the
contents of KDevelop's internal Messages-window.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile and use KDevelop, you need the following programs and libraries.
<p>
<bf>Required:</bf>
<itemize>
<item>gcc/g++ 2.7.2.1 (or compatible)
<item>perl 5.004
<item>autoconf 2.12
<item>automake 1.2
<item>Qt 1.42
<item>KDE 1.1
</itemize>
<p>
<bf>Optional:</bf>
<itemize>
<item>a2ps or enscript for printing support
<item>ghostview or kghostview for printing preview
<item>glimpse 4.0 for the search index
<item>sgmltools 1.0
<item>KDE-SDK with KDoc, KSgml2Html, KTranslator (available at <htmlurl url="http://developer.kde.org" name="developer.kde.org">)
<item>KDbg, KIconEdit (available at <htmlurl url="http://www.kde.org" name="www.kde.org">)
</itemize>

KDevelop was tested with SuSE Linux 5.2 on an AMD K6 200, 64MB RAM and FreeBSD 3.0-Release as well as SuSE Linux 6.0 on an Intel
200 MMX, 128MB RAM.

<bf>Documentation:</bf>	For creating the KDE library documentation, you need the kdelibs package in source available on your
system as provided by the KDE project or included with the source packages of your distribution and <bf>KDoc</bf> (included in the
KDE-SDK).

Also we're offering a C/C++ Reference on our <htmlurl url="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html"
name="homepage"> that is integrated into the documentation browser after it's installation. Download the package and
copy the source file as <tt/root/ into your KDE directory and untar it with <tt/tar zxvf c_c++_reference.tar.gz/, then the
reference is available in the documentation tree; otherwise selecting the reference book in the browser shows an error page with
the KDevelop homepage URL offering a download and describes the installation process.


<sect1>Compilation and Installation
<p>
In order to compile and install KDevelop on your system, type the following in the base directory of the KDevelop distribution:

<tscreen><verb>
	&percnt ./configure
	&percnt make

	(as root)
	
	&percnt make install
</verb></tscreen>


<p>Since KDevelop uses <tt>autoconf</tt> you should have not trouble compiling it.

In order to compile the KDevelop CVS snapshot, type the following :
<tscreen><verb>
	&percnt make -f Makefile.cvs
	&percnt ./configure
	&percnt make

	change as `root` and type:
	
	&percnt make install
</verb></tscreen>

If your system's make-command is <tt/gmake/, type <tt/gmake/ instead of <tt/make/.


<sect1>Starting KDevelop<p>
If you use KDE as your window manager, KDevelop can be started either with choosing "K"&rarr"Applications"&rarr"KDevelop". As
KDevelop supports KDE-Mime-types, you can also start by selecting a KDevelop project file ("*.kdevprj", displayed with the
KDevelop project icon) in the KDE File Manager which will start KDevelop and load the project.

Under other window managers, open a console and type:
<tscreen><verb>
&percnt kdevelop
</verb></tscreen>

Starting KDevelop with a certain project would be to change into the project-directory and to type:
<tscreen><verb> 	
&percnt kdevelop  &lt;yourProject&gt;.kdevprj
</verb></tscreen>

Under each user account KDevelop will invoke the <ref id="The Installation Program" name="automatic installation"> process on the
first start, allowing a quick configuration of the most needed options. If your installation is messed up, please delete your
kdeveloprc file and restart KDevelop, the automatic installation will be called again to set up KDevelop according to your system.


<sect1>The Installation Program<label id="The Installation Program">
<p>

KDevelop includes an automatic installation program module, which is invoked when starting the first time under the current
user account; meaning that the user's configuration file does not exist.  We advise following the installation steps by choosing
"Proceed" to automatically check your system and to set up your KDevelop environment.

The Installation dialog's buttons execute the following actions:
<p>
<bf>Help:</bf>  Will open  the KDEHelp program and open this page.
<p>
<bf>Proceed:</bf>  This will actually start the installation process and execute actions in the following order:

<enum>
<item> Checking for make/gmake, autoconf, autoheader, automake and perl for the creation and compilation of new applications
generated by KDevelop. If gmake is installed, the make-command will be set automatically to use gmake.  Other comandline options
to your make program can be set in the setup dialog accessed by the options menu later.

<item> Checking for KDoc and Glimpse.  Those will allow to create a new KDE-library documentation and a search index automatically
in a later setup step if found.

<item> Checking for a2ps and enscript to ensure that printing is available.  Either one of these programs have to be installed to
allow correct printing.

<item> Checking for KDbg,KIconedit and KTranslator.  We advise to install those programs as they are good
helpers to create complete KDE-applications. Note that KDbg is used directly for debugging your current project within KDevelop;
KIconedit is used to display and edit pixmaps selected in the file-viewer trees. The programs KDbg, KIconedit and KTranslator are
then configured to be available in the "Tools" menu of the KDevelop menu bar if they are found. Other tools can be added to the
Tools-menu by selecting "Tools..." in the Options menu later.

<item> Showing the summary dialog.  All tested programs are listed with found or not found, additional hints are given, if a
needed program is recommended.

<item> Then follows the detection of your Qt-online documentation path.  This checks for several standard path in your system for
the documentation and sets the path automatically.  If your Qt-Documentation could not be found, a message will appear that asks
you to set the correct path or to continue.  Choosing to set the path will return to the main installation window and shows an
editing field with a button on the right of it.  Choosing this button will open a directory selection dialog, where you can
switch to the directory the documentation is located. Usually this is in the qt/html directory. After doing so, the installation
can continue with the selection of "Proceed" again.

<item> If KDoc was detected, you are asked to create/update your KDE-library documentation.  For that, you need to have the
kde-libraries in source form. For Linux-Users who have installed KDE from a distribution, we advise to copy and extract the source
of the kdelibs-package to your system; Free BSD users who installed the kdelibs as a package should look for their according
distfile package of the ports-collection.   If none of these cases can be fulfilled, you should download the sources from
<htmlurl url="www.kde.org" name="www.kde.org"> and untar the sources on your system to create a documentation.  If you wish to use
the documentation package provided by <htmlurl url="developer.kde.org" name="developer.kde.org">, you can cancel the creation and
continue with creating the search index. Mind that the path to your kde-library documentation has to be set manually in the setup
dialog accessed by the options menu then.

<item> The "Update KDE-Library documentation" dialog is set up to use a default path for the location of the documentation
to create in $(HOME)/.kde/share/apps/kdevelop/KDE-Documentation.  The only thing you have to do is choosing the path to your
library sources with the selection button on top of the dialog and press OK. If the path was set correctly, you are asked if your
documentation should be created using the khtml  or the khtmlw library.  We advise to use khtml as khtmlw is older and exists for
compatibility reasons. New applications using HTML widgets should use khtml.  To avoid confusion while programming, we decided to
only include one of those for documentation.  If you are working on applications that use khtmlw, you should create a different
documentation with the <ref id="KDevelop Setup" name="KDevelop Setup"> in the options menu and use khtmlw then.    During the
creation of the documentation, a message in the installation window shows that it is in progress and you should wait for the next
message.
<bf>NOTE:</bf> On a multi-user system or systems with disk-quotas for user accounts, the creation of a complete HTML documentation
for each user would be a mere waste of disk space. In this case, ask you system administrator to run KDevelop under the
root account to allow write access to the system's root directory. The we advise to create the documentation within the
KDE-directory, under $KDEDIR/share/apps/kdevelop/KDE-Documentation. The correct path can then be set up later in the KDevelop
setup dialog, available in the "Options"-menu.

<item> If the system check found the Glimpse program on your system, you are offered to create a search database. The
search database can be created with the options of including the KDE-documentation and the Qt-documentation (default). Additionally
the online documentation of KDevelop is included and will be indexed.  If you have other documentation that should be indexed you
can select the directories and add them to the indexing process as well. If you wish to have direct access to these
documentations, you have to add them to the documentation tree later in KDevelop by a right-button click on the "Others" folder,
offering the addition of other documentations.

<item> During the creation of the search index, the installation window will show a message that this is in progress.

<item> If all installation steps were done correctly,  a final message shows that KDevelop will be started
after pressing OK and you are ready to start. Mind that you can set up additional options like auto saving in the <ref id="KDevelop
Setup" name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog that can be accessed by the options menu. </enum>

<bf>Cancel:</bf>  Will show a warning message that the installation process is going to be canceled.  This warning message allows to
return to the installation ("Back") or to start KDevelop with the default values ("Continue"). Mind that in this case you have to
set all options yourself with the configuration dialogs provided in the options-menu.



<sect>Programs<label id="Programs">
<p>
Now that KDevelop installed successfully and the most commonly used options are set, you are probably wondering if it keeps what
it promises. This Chapter gives you a guideline to how programs are created using the GNU tools in general and especially what
part KDevelop plays in this game.

<sect1>The Compiler<label id="The Compiler"> <p>
The compiler is actually the program on your system that has to be installed as a minimum to create running programs; he is the
one that compiles the source code into object files and creates the program.

Normally, you would start like this:
Open an editor of your choice - don't use a word-processor. Type in something like this to create the source for your first
program:

<tscreen><verb>
#include <iostream.h>

int main(){

cout << "Hello World" << endl;

}
</verb></tscreen>
Well, actually all the program will do is to print out the string "Hello World" to your standard output. But this is just the
source code for the program to be build, not the program itself. Therefore, we need a compiler, in this case a C++-compiler like
g++. Then we can save the file with the source code, as, let's say, myprogram.cpp and invoke the compiler with the filename
(on a console):

<tscreen><verb>
g++ -o myprogram myprogram.cpp
</verb></tscreen>
Then we can start our program- just type <tt/myprogram/  on the console, and the program prints out the string; then exits.


<sect1>Make and Makefiles<label id="Make"><p>
I have everything I need: an editor, a compiler and I can execute my own C++ program. But it isn't all that easy. What happens if
you have more than one source file ? And, do you have to compile all sources over and over again only if you changed one file ?
Compiling will become more and more complicated and time-consuming, because you have to type in all the commands and options
yourself. Therefore, you could write a so-called "Makefile". You could also call it some other name except the name of the program
to build. Then, you should have the tool <tt/make/ or <tt/gmake/ installed, or any other tool that is capable of keeping track of
a project's compilation. Insert all your compiler commands in a certain syntax into that Makefile and save it; then you will only
have to type <tt/make/ or <tt/gmake/ on the console in the directory where your Makefile is located, and then make takes over,
leading the compiler to create your application. The make utility has many other advantages and can be used to a lot of purposes.
To get a complete overview, open a console and type:

<tt/man make/

or search for "GNU Make" in KDEHelp, "System GNU Info contents".
At least, you have an insight, why a developer needs the make utility for making it easier to compile his application.
Now, writing Makefiles is not only handwork until now, you also have to dig yourself into the whole syntax and options. But here
is the good news about KDevelop and any Make-utility: You just have to set the Make-Command in the <ref id="KDevelop Setup"
name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog, and then you're done. All projects generated with KDevelop will use that Make command to build the
target application, and no typing at all. Just hit the buttons on the toolbar of KDevelop, beginning with the one after the second
separator line, or choose the desired function for Make in the "Build" menu.

The toolbar and the build-menu then offer the most-common functions that you need to let make do the dirty work:

<itemize>
<item> Compile File: is only active if you're working on a source file. It invokes make with the correct command to compile only
the current source.
<item> Make: just calls make and creates your target.
<item> Rebuild all: rebuilds the whole project
<item> Clean/Rebuild all: cleans the project directory first and then runs make again.
<item> Stop Build: cancels the current process- this is mostly used if you watch make working and staring at your sources. Then-
ahh- I forgot about this line...and you have to correct your code. Just hit Stop, correct the error you found by yourself and run
Make again.
</itemize>

But this is not the only way how KDevelop works together with make- for KDE applications, there are some things that are special,
like creating the message files for internationalization. These functions are also included, so no worry about these things
anymore.

Until now, you know about sources, the compiler and why make is needed. In the next section, we'll discuss how it comes that
projects created with KDevelop automatically can be compiled on most other Unix-platforms using the <tt/configure-/ script.

<sect1>Configure<label id="Configure"><p>
The title of this section lets you probably question: Configure ? What has to be configured ? Or who ?
Well, assume you have written a program including a Makefile. Then you like to distribute it, but the binary compiled does only
run on your system or on systems that are compatible with yours. To support other platforms like different Unix-systems or
machines like Alpha's or RISC's, you have to recompile the program. The easiest way would be to copy the source package to the
target machine and run <tt/make/ again. But what if the target machine uses another compiler command or has in some other way a
problem to build your binary ? Not to mention more difficult issues like installation paths for your program and documentation-
e.g. KDE can be installed in <tt//opt/kde/ on one machine, while it is installed under <tt//usr/local/kde/ on another. In this
case, you would have to rewrite the Makefile each time to ensure a correct compilation and installation of your product.

Fortunately, GNU-tools have even more to provide than that mighty <tt/make/- the commonly used automake and autoconf
packages. It sounds good to hear something with "auto"- seems like something about application design can be done quick and easy,
which exactly hits the point.

Automake's purpose is generally to create a so-called <tt/Makefile.in/ from a file <tt/Makefile.am/ which you have to write for
your project. This Makefile.am consists of macros which can be interpreted and reduce the complexity that make offers, so a
Makefile.am is written safer and quicker than the final Makefile.

Having this said, who is finally creating me my Makefile ? Now, here comes autoconf. Autoconf requires several macro files
for the project. That are those Makefile.in's generated by automake and a file called <tt/configure.in/, also containing macros.
Hereby the Makefile.am and .in's are containing macros that are responsible for the way how to build the software in terms of
which sources have to be compiled, which files belong to the package and what name the final binary or library will have after a
build. Configure.in on the other hand contains macros for what the final configure-shell script will check for on the system
configure is executed. Those could be e.g. the compiler command, required libraries against which the final binary will be linked,
include-files the project needs and their location.

For example you want to write a KDE application. After writing your sources,
you want to distribute the program to the user community, and each user has to compile the binary on his own. Then you would write
a configure.in file that contains the macros for a KDE-compliant application. That one macro finally expands to a check on the
system whether the Qt-library is installed, checks for the Qt-header files, the KDE-libraries and headers etc.

<bf>Summary:</bf>  To create a GNU-compliant application that is portable to different Unix-OS's and machines other than yours,
you will need to do the following:

<enum>
<item> write the sources of your project
<item> write a Makefile.am for each subdirectory, including the main project directory of your project
<item> write a configure.in file placed in the main project directory containing the macros for system requirements
<item> run automake
<item> run autoconf
</enum>

Then the main work is done. Automake creates the Makefile.in's, autoconf processes the configure.in and Makefile.in's and
generates an executable shell script called <tt/configure/. All you then have to do is to execute it with  <tt/./configure/ and
the script will run the checks of your choice. Finally Makefiles will be generated that allow a final execution of make (or gmake)
that will process all Makefiles and then you're done.

This seems to be a lot of stuff for writing a small application and much to learn especially how to write correct macros. But even
the fact that you provide a compilation on almost all Unix-systems will be worth this work sooner or later. Finally, you only have
to do this work once for your project and in case your project's files increase you only have to add the filenames to the macros.


Now, how far does KDevelop support this kind of application development and how complicated does it get for the programmer ?
The good news is, that you don't even have to know anything about macros and scripts. All details are hidden behind an easy to use
graphical interface doing the work for you. An application is therefore created with GNU tools in a very user-friendly way:

Just generate your application with KAppWizard, by the choice of your application's needs- may it be a pure C++ terminal
application or a kind of GUI program using Qt or the Qt/KDE libraries. All work is done automatically and your project already
contains the Makefiles that are created by an auto-execution of the GNU-tools and the configure-script.

This is it- you're ready to extend the source of your project, may it be by adding classes, dialogs, translations or
documentation, which is also completely automated. Just concentrate on the real work of the developer, which is providing
functionality for the final application that you want to create. In most cases, you probably won't come in touch with Makefiles at
all when using KDevelop.

<sect1>Debugging<label id="Debugging"> <p>
The following section covers a term that is widely used by developers: Debugging.  It means, that, although your compiler produces
the final application, your application may not run or crash during execution due to a so-called "bug" in the code. A program
error described by the name of this insect comes from the history of computing; one of the first errors that caused a machine to
crash was not obviously a malfunction- bugs were inside the computer which were responsible for it. Therefore, an error not
detectable on the first look is called a "bug", so "debugging" means to throw out bugs where they shouldn't be. Now, you don't
have to hunt them for real; assuming that today's computers are designed to keep them out by some kind of outer protection.
They have to be found inside the code, mostly ending the execution of a program with the message "Segmentation fault". GNU
provides another tool called <tt/gdb/, the GNU debugger. This terminal program allows to watch the internal values of an
application and the execution step by step with setting "breakpoints" in the code. Gdb stops the execution every time the program
comes to a breakpoint while executing. But like most other tools, the debugger is handled by another program providing a frontend
to it, allowing to easily watch values and the setting of breakpoints in the code.

For this purpose, your project's application is by default created with a compiler option for debugging, thereby storing
additional data in the executable to allow the localization of values and lines in the code. As a third-party frontend to gdb,
KDevelop makes use of KDbg, the KDebugger. To debug your program, you just have to select "Debug" in the Build-menu or press the
according toolbar button displayed by a wheel having glasses over it, signaling that you want to watch the execution.

KDevelop then opens the Tools-window and starts your application with KDbg. The KDbg interface appears inside the Tools-window and
allows the usage just like you started it from outside.

In general, the above steps are clearly showing the need of certain steps that a developer has to do when starting to write his
own application, and cover issues that are common to all projects. Also, we explained what part KDevelop does for a developer and
how it supports the idea of providing an easy way to Unix programming. To get further information about the role and purpose of
GNU tools, you should read the documentation provided with them, commonly accessed via the <tt/man/ command or by the "System GNU
Info contents" section in KDEHelp.

<sect>Development with KDevelop<label id="Developing with KDevelop">
<p>
In this chapter you will get a general overview how you can use KDevelop and the internal Dialogeditor to create own applications.
Thereby, all tools are described by their use during the development process. If you are a beginner in C++/GUI design and
programming, you should read <bf/"The KDevelop Programming Handbook"/, which describes some basics for program design and shows a
more detailed use of KDevelop by sample projects which you can follow step-by-step to get used with the way applications are
created using KDevelop. Also you should have read chapter 3, <ref id="Programs" name="Programs"> to gain a general understanding
why Unix applications should make use of provided development tools; this will make things easier when you hit references to what
Makefiles are etc.<p>
<sect1>What are KDevelop Project Applications ?<p>
Projects created with KDevelop make it very easy for developers to use the GNU standard development tools. In opposition to the
self-creation of Makefiles, which have to be written anyway because of the project's complexity, those provide not only a better
way of Makefile generation but also a good and safe way to provide a fast adaption towards different systems by autoconf-generated
<tt/configure/ scripts.

The distribution of your applications does not require the end-user to have anything different installed than a C++ compiler and
the development libraries, which is most often the case; but you can as well distribute binary packages of your application. In
either way, the end-user of your product does not have to have KDevelop installed. For giving away your sources, we advise to
include the project file of KDevelop as well, as this makes it very easy for other developers to work with your sources if they
use KDevelop as well. For projects where several developers, maybe working on different places, are involved, this should the case
anyway to ensure consistency of the Makefiles so you don't run into trouble. Especially on multi language applications, translators
won't actually work with the source code, except in cases that require corrections for enabling translation support. Anyway, those
will be thankful as KDevelop simplifies their work to a minimum by adding their language and reducing the work to concentrate on
the translation.


With using KDevelop for your own projects, you would start creating a new application with the KAppWizard. There, you can also
set the project type according the goals of your program. Then, you would start developing the user interface by adding
widgets that are already constructed in the libraries and only have to be called by your application, or by self-constructions
that can be made with the dialogeditor. Next comes the extension of the user interface by changing and extending those parts that
are already made by KDevelop like the statusbar, menubar and toolbars. As resources are collected in a resource file, this can be
extended simply by adding new values to the already existing one; the given resources can also be used as a guideline for adding
your specific ones. After implementing the functionality to methods that are either generated empty by the dialogeditor or already
containing code for standard user actions, you should extend the User Manual by simply editing the provided sgml index file
towards describing your applications capabilities. The last step would be to generate translation files and to distribute your
project to translators doing the rest to enhance internationalization.

But even for non-GUI application designers the IDE offers an easy way to create new projects; the editor and classbrowser in
conjunction with KDevelop's powerful project management will reduce the time for development to the minimum that is required for
implementation of functionality.

<sect1>Short Description of KDevelop's Tools<p>
With KDevelop you have chosen a package, that, in conjuction with the use of other tools, will provide you a prefect and flexible
environment for object-orientated application development under Unix-Systems. Generally, KDevelop consists of the programming
environment and the dialogeditor; besides that all needed programs that can be helpful for designing applications are embedded in
one or the other way.

<sect2>Programming Environment and Dialogeditor
<p>
<sect3>The Programming Environment
<p>
The Programming Environment is the user interface that KDevelop provides for creating and maintaining projects, implicitly using
many other tools by simplifying their use. It's build-in Editor and Helpbrowser as well as the Classbrowser reduce the amount of
work that development processes usually burden on the programmer. The ease of use make writing applications for Unix an enjoyment
on it's own and will probably result in shorter release cycles and better development improvements. From here, you're managing
your project throughout all its details, keep the overview over your classes and don't have to use additional consoles for your
work, as well as the integration of all user interfaces results in the fact that you only have to work with one window under X and
don't have to watch for several ones spread all over your desktop.

<sect3>The Dialogeditor
<p>
KDevelop's build-in dialogeditor offers a simple way of designing user interfaces with the Qt and KDE libraries. It's simple way
to do almost everything with the mouse allows a rapid construction of dialogs and main views for applications and their direct
transformation into C++ code, which is directly added to the project. As the dialogeditor is embedded into the rest of KDevelop's
user interface, you have the same commands available than working in Programming mode. This allows e.g. construction of a dialog,
generation of the code output and it's direct testing within the program by the availability of the make-commands and you still
can control the compiler output without having to switch back to the programming view.

<sect2>KAppWizard and the Classtools
<p>
The KAppWizard and the Classtools provided for project generation and automatic code extension are intended to make the
creation of applications as easy and safe as possible and offers a good way for beginners in Qt/KDE programming to start actually
working themselves into the details of GUI application design, as results can be achieved very quickly.

<sect3>KAppWizard
<p>
KAppWizard is intended to create full-functional application projects that are ready-to-run by using GNU-standard tools and, for
GUI-programs, taking advantage of the KDE and Qt libraries. By specifying only the information that is required as a minimum,
users are enabled to start working at a new project within seconds. Calling KAppWizard should be the first step to be done for
creating a new application with KDevelop.

KAppWizard provides you a so-called application skeleton with all needed C++ source code files for a running application. After
you specified a projectname and set the needed preferences, your new project will be generated and you have a completely new
application that already contains a lot of functionality (for KDE and Qt projects), without even having to type one line of C++
code yourself. When specifying the complete set of options the program generator offers, your application already contains:

<itemize>
<item>an SDI-Interface (for working with one document per application window), based on the document-view-controller model
<item>Menus and dialogs for opening and saving files as well as printing dialogs
<item>a toolbar and statusbar already providing complete functionality
<item>a helpsystem, containing an sgml-based user manual and statusbar help
<item>a complete HTML-based API (application programming interface) documentation for the current state of the project
<item>an installation routine though make
</itemize>

The KAppWizard is available by the Project-menu, entry "Application Wizard".

<sect3>Classtools
<p>
The term "Classtools" describes a variety of functions that are available for the developer to work on a project not only by
an object-orientated language but using the sources in an object-orientated way. Working with classes instead of having to
watch for files offers a very flexible way to extend a project and lets the user concentrate on the objects the project contains.
The tools that KDevelop offers are a Classgenerator and a Classbrowser, where each one provides a lot of automated
functionality.

<sect4> Creating a new class with the Classgenerator
<p>
After generating a project with the KAppWizard your work as a developer would be to add a set of classes that match the design of
the application. The typical process without using KDevelop would be to create a new header and sourcefile, add them manually to
the according Makefile.am and to start writing the classes declaration and implementation. To simplify the whole process, the
Classgenerator lets you do this by only specifying the new class by its name, inherited class, inheritance attribute and further
information such as class documentation by it's purpose for the project. Additionally, you can also change the filenames that are
preset by the generator and if the class would be Qt-signal/slot enabled by default.

The rest of the work is done automatically- you don't have to take care for Makefile.am, files and the class itself. A new "make"
invocation is enough to include the new class in the compilation process. As the Classbrowser updates itself after the addition of
a class, the declaration and implementation is available at once and you can start working on the extension of the class. The
Classgenerator is invoked by the Project-menu, entry "New Class".

<sect4>The Classbrowser
<p>
The Classbrowser displays all types of objects and fuctions of your project in a tree left of the editing windows. A classparser
scans all files for methods and classes and makes them available by graphical symbols. Over those, context-menus offer a
specialized functionality to work with the sources by focusing on the classes and functions.

Selecting a class will result in opening the file that contains the declaration; on methods and functions this will
show you the implementation. For a full description, see <ref id="The Classbrowser" name="The Classbrowser">


<sect1> The Development Process
<p>
The development of a new application with KDevelop can generally be divided into two major steps: first, you have to generate a
program skeleton with KAppWizard, then the "rest" of the development has to be done using KDevelop's features, which only
requires your abilities as a programmer. To describe the development process, we assume you want to create a Qt/KDE application,
which implies using most of KDevelop's features for working with these types of project, so you have a general "HOW-TO".

<sect2>Creating a Program Skeleton
<p>
To start creating your application, you normally would call the KAppWizard, enter the project name and generate the program. By
this, the wizard automatically creates a project file for the application and inserts the KDevelop areas into the Makefile.am's
which will be used later when extending the application. The project file is the file you have to load for opening the project in
later sessions.

You call KAppWizard by the "Project"-menu, entry "Application Wizard". When the wizard appears, you have to specify the project
type on the first page. Selecting "Next >>" brings you to the next page where you have to insert the project name, version,
directory and your personal information. Page 3 offers more detailed options, page 4 and 5 allow editing file headers for header
and implementation files that are inserted automatically according to your selection. If you already have file headers you want to
use, you can choose those files as well. The last page contains an output window and an error message window. When selecting
"Create", your application will be generated and the actions that are executed can be seen in the output window. If READY appears
in the output window, the KAppWizard is finished and you can select "Exit" to return to the Programming Environment. To build the
binary, choose "Make" from the Build-menu or choose the according button in the toolbar. You can as well test the functions already
present by choosing "Execute" from the Build-menu.


<sect2>Developing an Application
<p>
This section describes the development phase of applications with KDevelop and the Dialogeditor- and all work can be done within
the IDE.

The development steps are generally to edit the source files, the compilation of the project sources followed by the linker
process binding all object files to the final binary. Then errors have to be located which either prevented a compilation or
linking or are semantical bugs that can be found by a debugging session. Finally, the documentation has to be extended and
translations have to be added. But as all those steps can mix which each other, it is not that easy to describe a general way how
to develop your own application. Typically, the usual procedure would be to first create all visible parts of the project like the
main view and the dialogs for configuring any options, then generate the source code and implement all needed connections that
still have to be done like changing the menubar and toolbars, adding statusbar help for new menu entries and fill the new member
functions with objects that are displaying your dialogs. Then you would compile your application and test it's capabilities, fix
errors and test it again. The following sections describe how this would be done; for your particular application
you may choose another way- KDevelop leaves you enough flexibility to decide what to do at what time.

<sect3>User Interfaces
<p>
The User Interface of an application is actually what the user sees and by which he interacts with the program. Therefore a
program generally has a menubar, toolbars and a statusbar as well as a main view which would be e.g. a text input window for an
editor. KAppWizard generated applications already contain a complex functionality on graphical interfaces- the frame structure
takes care of standard elements such as bars and buttons. When developing your application, you have to extend the given structure
to give the program the user interaction capability you want to provide. One part of the work is the design of dialogs e.g. for
changing values like the brush width in a paint application. This can be done easily with the Dialogeditor inside KDevelop. Now,
how do you create those good-looking dialogs ? As the Qt library is a GUI toolkit, it provides a base set of so-called "widgets"
like labels displaying plain text, lineedits for text input and buttons for navigation and selection commands. Besides these
"low-level" parts of user interfaces, standard dialogs are provided and are ready to use such as printing dialogs. The
KDE-libraries then are based on the Qt-library and contain replacements for certain dialogs as well as additional widgets that can
be used in your application. So, when you start designing your applications behavior towards the user, you should make yourself
comfortable with the widgets provided with Qt and KDE. The online-documentation of Qt offers screenshots for most of them, so you
should have a look there first. Then we advise to have a closer look at the KDE-UI library, offering other widgets. Libraries like
the KHTML library contains very specialized widgets that a lot of programs make use of. It just simplifies application design like
the predefined dialogs provided with Qt. For your own dialogs, those low-level widgets are the one you need. A dialog merely
consists by a collection of different widgets combined together building the interface and is technically programmed by C++ code
in a class that is derived from QWidget or a more specialized dialog class that inherits QWidget. The program using the widget
therefore needs an object of the widget's class- this is almost all you have to understand how dialogs or views are used.

The Dialogeditor of KDevelop now offers a nice way to simply construct dialogs and user interfaces visually instead of you having
to combine dialogs with pure C++ code together- this is the hard way to create interfaces. Switch to the Dialogeditor by
choosing the according entry in the "Tools"-menu (or by the toolbar button). You will see that KDevelop's face has changed but for
e.g. the menubar and the toolbar are very similar. This makes it very easy to switch back and forth between the two working modes
and you will feel comfortable in both after some time. There you can construct your views and dialogs as you like and set all
available preferences for the items the view will contain. When you're finished, select "Generate Sources" from the Build-menu;
the Dialogeditor and the project management will take care of the rest. You can test if everything went OK by selecting Make or
Execute, this will build your application including your new sources. But don't expect that dialogs are already usable- this is a
matter of implementation that is the usual way a developer works. Don't worry- this isn't too difficult, too. For more information
about creating dialogs, see <ref id="The Dialogeditor" name="The Dialogeditor">, examples and guidelines can also be found in
<bf/"The KDevelop Programming Handbook"/.

<sect3>Binding New Elements
<p>
After you have created your user interfaces and generated the sources, you are ready to make your application use them by objects.
As described above, a usual GUI-based program contains bars and the main view; additionally the main view operates with the bars,
which are part of the main application class, and the document object which it is connected to. In terms of object-oriented
design, you would describe the given architecture as the "Document-View-Controller"-model. This model describes the basic
functions for objects in an application towards their role within the program. The Controller represents the one coordinating the
main application and provides user interaction through a menubar and additionally toolbars and a statusbar. The Document class
takes the task of representing a document the user works with. Therefore, a document class should do all actions like loading
files and saving them again. The view now is in the center of the application window, showing the user a part of the document
visually and provides all functions to manipulate the data by the user. As the bars and toolbars are already present, your work
would be to create the main view and additional dialogs by which the user can change any settings or has access to additional
functions.

To build your main-view, the generated source code for your application already contains a class in the form of
&lt;YourApplication&gt;View which inherits the QWidget class (this is the minimal class that handles visual interfaces in Qt and
therefore in KDE as well). In general, there are three different ways how to extend the given class:

<itemize>
<item>remove the document-view structure and use one of the predefined "big" widgets already containing a lot of functionality-
just remove the View-class and replace the view-object by another.
<item>change the inheritance of the View-class. Change the inheritance to e.g. QMultiLineEdit and your application would be an
editor.
<item>if your main view will consist of several separated parts, create the widgets and their classes you need with the
dialogeditor and create objects of these classes in the view-class constructors that in combination will build the main view.
</itemize>

For dialogs, things are a bit different. The usual way would be to call a dialog through a menubar entry and additionally by a
toolbar icon. After you constructed your dialog and generated the sources, the class is available for creating an object that will
be the dialog. So you first have to look for a suitable place in the menubar to add an entry which will open the dialog when
selected by the user. If the already given menus do not match your needs, create a new popup menu just like the others and insert
your entry and the slot you want to call when the menuitem gets selected. Then implement the slot by creating an instance of the
dialog class and call the dialog with the member functions given by the base class. Also you have to specify an ID for the
menuentry. The frame applications have all IDs already given collected in a file resource.h, so you only have to add the ID and
give it a new number. Then you're done- additionally you could construct another toolbar icon and add the statushelp message. Your
application now offers a new functionality which is visible to the user. Now you have to add the implementation of methods that
your dialog will be operating with to manipulate any values. Finally, call your make-tool or "Execute" and the changed files will
be recompiled; the result of your changes can then be tested immediately.

<sect>Overview<label id="Overview">
<p>
Looking at KDevelop, the user interface can be described by it's logical separation: the main window, the treeview and the
output window, surrounded by the menubar, toolbars and the statusbar. This section describes the purpose of each part of the
interface, starting by the windows, followed by the bars and the functions they provide.
<sect1>Main Window
<p>

The main window consists of four tabulators for which the left two are for editing purpose. First comes the Header-/Resource
window for headers and any other text files like the documentation sgml's, then the C/C++ window for sourcecodes. These are
followed by the Documentation window displaying in HTML-format. At last is the Tools window for external programs like KIconedit
and KDbg which are embedded into the IDE. Any Tool that is registered can be accessed via the Tools-menu; whereas the registration
of third-party programs can easily be done by a configuration dialog (see section 11, <ref id="General Configuration"
name="configuration">). For a description of the Editor windows functionality, see chapter 7,<ref id="Working with the Editor"
name="Working with the Editor">, and for the Helpbrowser, you should look at section <ref id="Using the Documentation Browser"
name="Using the Documentation Browser">.
<sect1> The Classbrowser and Fileviewers
<p>
<sect2>The Class Viewer
<p>
The Class Viewer (CV) shows the classes of your project as well as global functions and variables.  Opening the tree will show all
member functions and members with symbols for attributes (private, protected and public, signals and slots), so you can see the
properties of members visually without switching to the header file.  Selecting the class name will open the according
headerfile containing the class and set the cursor to the class declaration beginning. Selecting member functions will open the
implementation file and place the cursor at the function header.	For elements, KDevelop will look for the header file and place
the cursor at the line the element is declarated.	The classviewer also provides popup-menus that offer more specified options,
see <ref id="The Classbrowser" name="The Classbrowser"> for more detailed information.

<sect2>The Logical File Viewer
<p>
The Logical File Viewer (LFV) allows sorting files by filters in groups. Individual groups can be added by the properties
entry of the project menu or by a right click on the tree items. This allows a more specialized search for files that you want to
access quickly, in the first place only showing project-included files. According to their Mime-type, the files will be opened
when selected. You will like the LFV for things like selecting pixmaps- this will start KIconEdit (if installed on the system) in
the Tools-window and opens the chosen picture.

<sect2>The Real File Viewer
<p>
The Real File Viewer (RFV) shows the project directory tree with all files, so you can edit non-project files or files hidden by
the LFV like configure.in and Makefiles.
Popup-menus also provide functions like adding or removing files to the current project.

<sect2>The Documentation Tree
<p>
The Documentation Tree (DOC) displays all available HTML-based documentation that is configured as books. Selecting a book will
open the first page in the Browser window. Also, a popup-menu provides personal configuration for additional HTML-based
documentation packages.

<sect1>Output window<p> The Output window is separated as well into a messages window, a stdin/stdout
window and a stderr window for the following necessities:
<itemize>
<item> messages window:	displays all output of the compiler. Clicking on error messages will change the edit widget to set the
cursor to the line the compiler found an error.
<item> stdout window: display for terminal based applications that send messages to the standard output of the computer. Note that
Terminal applications are now started in an external console window.
<item> stderr window: displays all the error messages your program
produces. This is useful for testing purposes. The Output window is programmed to show up each time an external process is called,
such as make or a terminal application.
</itemize>

<sect1>Menubar Commands<p>
<sect2>File Management and Printing<p>
This section covers the functions that KDevelop provides about files; accessed via the File-menu in the menubar or by the
according icons in the toolbar:

<itemize>
<item><bf/New			Ctrl+N/ Opens the "New File" dialog, allowing to create a new file. The file can be created using different templates
and the filename has to be given as well as the path where the file will be created.<p>
<item><bf/Open			Ctrl+O/ displays the "Open File..." dialog and lets you choose a file to be opened.<p>
<item><bf/Close		Ctrl+W/ Closes the file in the top editing window<p>
<item><bf/Save			Ctrl+S/	Saves the file opened in the top editing window. If the file has not been saved yet, the "Save File As..."
dialog will be opened to let you choose a path and filename for the file to be saved.<p>
<item><bf/Save As.../ Opens the "Save File As..." dialog to let you save the current file under a new filename<p>
<item><bf/Save All/ Saves all changed files<p>
<item><bf/Print...	Ctrl+P/ Opens the "Print File" dialog where you can set various options for printing either using a2ps, enscript or
lpr<p>
<item><bf/Quit			Ctrl+Q/ Exits KDevelop. If files are changed, you will be asked if you want to save these files.<p>
</itemize>
<p>


<sect2>Editing Files<p>
Here, the "Edit" menu and the according icons in the toolbar are covered which provide editing files. Also the editing functions
are available via a context-menu in the editor.
<itemize>
<item><bf/Undo			Ctrl+Z/ Reverts the last editing operation<p>
<item><bf/Redo	Ctrl+Z/ lets you do the last undo step again<p>
<item><bf/Cut			Ctrl+X/ cuts out a selection and copies it to the system clipboard.<p>
<item><bf/Copy			Ctrl+C/ copies a selection to the system clipboard. This also counts for selections made in the documentation
browser.<p>
<item><bf/Paste		Ctrl+V/ inserts the clipboard contents at the current cursor position.<p>
<item><bf/Indent		Ctrl+I/ Indent moves a selection to the right<p>
<item><bf/UnIndent	Ctrl+U/ UnIndent moves a selection to the left<p>
<item><bf/Insert File.../ Lets you select a file and inserts its contents at the current cursor position<p>
<item><bf/Search...		Ctrl+F/Opens the Search dialog that looks for an expression in the current file. For a search across several
files, "Search in files..." should be used.<p>
<item><bf/Repeat Search	F3/ Repeats the last search for an expression. This also counts for searches that were made across the
documentation, where more than one hit was found in the same page. The next hit will be displayed by choosing "Repeat Search"
or F3 and signed as marked.<p>
<item><bf/Replace...		Ctrl+R/ Opens the "Search and Replace" dialog that allows the search for an expression and replaces the found
text with a new expression.<p>

<item><bf/Search in files...		Ctrl+Alt+F/Displays the "Search in files..." dialog, that handles <tt/grep/ on whole directories with
wildcards. Search results are displayed with a list of the filenames, line and expression. Choosing an entry will open the file
and the cursor is set to the line of the search result<p>
<item><bf/Select All/ Selects the whole text of the file currently opened in the top editing window<p>
<item><bf/Deselect All/ Deselects the whole text of the current file. This is often used for multiple selections so you don't have
to deselect each one separately<p>
<item><bf/Invert Selection/ Inverts the selection, meaning that a selection becomes deselected and text which is not selected
becomes selected.<p>
</itemize>
<p>

<sect2>View Configuration<p>
The View-Menu covers closing and opening functions for windows and commands to enable/disable the tool- and statusbar as well as
to jump errors in the code.
<itemize>
<item><bf/Line...	Ctrl+L/Opens a "Go to Line..." dialog that lets you insert a linenumber to show in the actual file. The last
linenumber is remembered and marked, so you can either jump to that line again or just enter a new linenumber you want to see.<p>
<item><bf/Next Error		F4/Jumps to the next error KDevelop detects from the output. The output message of Make or other tools should
give you a descriptive help what the problem is, so you can correct the error.<p>
<item><bf/Previous Error		Shift+F4/ Jumps to the previous error that was reported.<p>
<item><bf/Tree-View	Ctrl+T/en/disables the Tree window on the left side of the main view containing the classbrowser, LFV, RFV and
DOC-tree.<p>
<item><bf/Output-View	Ctrl+G/en/disables the Output window on the bottom of the main view.<p>
<item><bf/Toolbar/en/disables the toolbar.<p>
<item><bf/Browser-Toolbar/en/disables the browser toolbar, containing the back, forward and search buttons for the browser<p>
<item><bf/Statusbar	Ctrl+B/en/disables the statusbar.<p>
<item><bf/Refresh/ rescans all files to rebuild the classbrowser. The scanning progress is shown in the statusbar progress display.<p>
</itemize>
<p>

<sect2>Creating and Maintaining Projects<p>
This section describes functions that are available in the "Project"-menu and are supposed to cover the creation and maintaining
of projects
<itemize>
<item><bf/Application Wizard/ Starts the KAppWizard and allows you to create a new project by choosing application type, name,
version and other options.<p>
<item><bf/New.../Opens the New Project dialog to let you create empty projects that can be adapted to be used with existing
non-kdevelop projects.<p>
<item><bf/Open/ Shows the Open Project dialog, where you can choose a KDevelop project file to be opened. After selection, the
project will be loaded.<p>
<item><bf/Close/Closes the current project. This is mostly done automatically when you quit KDevelop, invoke the KAppWizard or open
another project.<p>
<item><bf/New Class.../Starts the class generator to create a new class that will be added to the current project. The class
generator lets you specify classname, inheritance and filenames for the new class.<p>
<item><bf/Add File(s) to Project/<p>
<item><bf/New File.../ Opens the New File dialog to let you create and add a new file to the current project.<p>
<item><bf/Existing file(s)/ Opens a selection dialog where you can choose the files that you want to add to the current project and the
path where they will be copied to. If you choose a destination that was currently not included in the project, e.g. creating a new
subdirectory, KDevelop will copy the files to add to the new subdirectory and create a new Makefile.am. After the copy process,
your project will be rebuild by automake and autoconf to include the new subdirectory into the make-process.<p>
<item><bf/Add new translation file/ Opens a language selection dialog that lets you choose the translation file language that will be
added to the project. This is mostly used by translators who can easily add their language to the project and work on the
translation without having to care about the Makefile.am's<p>
<item><bf/File Properties/ Opens the File Properties dialog showing a copy of the LFV and the project file options. Here, the
properties for your files have to be set like installation path and file type.<p>
<item><bf/Options/ Opens the Project Options dialog that lets you change various settings for your project. This could be a
new version number or the compiler options to set to -02 for a release with optimization.<p>
</itemize>
<p>

<sect2>Building Projects<p>
This section describes the Build menu that covers all actions to be done with make or actions like rebuilding the project's online
help or API documentation.

<itemize>
<item><bf/Compile file.../Active, if the top editing window is the C++ Window. This only compiles the current implementation file
and lets you save time in case you suspect errors.<p>
<item><bf/Make/ Invokes the make-command to your project and builds the target.<p>
<item><bf/Rebuild All/ Rebuilds all object files and the target of you project.<p>
<item><bf/Clean Rebuild All/ Cleans the project directory from all make-created files and rebuilds the target.<p>
<item><bf/Stop Build/ Stops the current process.<p>
<item><bf/Execute/ Executes your target after building the program with make.<p>
<item><bf/Execute with Arguments/ Executes your target with arguments that you have to set first with the "Execution Arguments" option
of the Build-menu.<p>
<item><bf/Debug.../ Opens KDbg in the Tools-Window to debug your application. In this case, KDbg automatically opens the file
containing the main() function and executes your application.<p>
<item><bf/Distclean/ Removes all files that are generated by the project like object files etc. Distclean has to be done before
distributing your project, so the distribution file doesn't contain any platform-specific files like those that were generated by
your compiler.<p>
<item><bf/Autoconf/ Calls Make on the file Makefile.dist, located in your main project directory. Makefile.dist contains all commands
for automake, autoconf etc. to build your project. If you added files manually or changed macros yourself, you should run Autoconf
afterwards, followed by Configure to recreate all Makefiles.<p>
<item><bf/Configure/ Executes the configure-script generated by autoconf. If this command cannot be executed, run Autoconf and then
Configure again.<p>
<item><bf/Execution Arguments/ Here you can set the arguments you want to add to the execution of your application by "Execute with
Arguments". Your argument settings for the execution are saved in the project, so you don't have to set arguments again after
changing to another project or when you initialize your project again the next time you start KDevelop.<p>
<item><bf/Make messages and merge/ This is intended to create the messages file for your project. The message file is the one
containing all strings that are set up in the sources for internationalization and is used by translators to create the .po file
for their target language.<p>
<item><bf/Make API-Doc/ Calls KDoc on your header files and generates a HTML output with the documentation of your project
classes.<p>
<item><bf/Make User-Manual/ runs ksgml2html on your manual sgml file, creating a HTML user manual. If ksgml2html is not installed,
sgml2html will be used to do this.<p>

</itemize>
<p>

<sect2>Calling Tools<p>
The Tools-menu contains by default the entries for the internal Dialogeditor (which can also be started by the toolbar button) and
the following programs if installed: KDbg, KIconEdit and KTranslator. These are checked by the KDevelop installation program and
inserted in the given order into the menu. Invoking a tool will open the "Tools"-window and start the selected program inside this
window. The Tools menu can be edited by the Tools-entry in the Options-menu.

<sect2>Changing KDevelop's settings<p>
The Options-menu contains all entries for invoking configuration dialogs with which you can change KDevelop's default settings.
Major settings like those for the editor or printing have their own entries; general settings of KDevelop's behavoir can be made
with the <ref id="KDevelop Setup" name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog.

<itemize>
<item><bf/Editor.../ Allows the configuration of the editor's behavoir like word-breaking, selections etc.<p>
<item><bf/Editor Colors.../ Here, you can set the color-configuration of the editor like e.g. the background.<p>
<item><bf/Editor Defaults.../ This sets the default display like font and fontsize for the editor<p>
<item><bf/Syntax-Highlighting / This dialog lets you configure the fonts and colors for the highlighting of several programming
languages, including HTML, and the mime-types highlighting will be enabled to.<p>
<item><bf/Documentation Browser/ In this tab-dialog, you can set the fonts, sizes and colors for the internal Helpbrowser<p>
<item><bf/Configure Printer.../ Contains the entries for the printer configuration dialogs according to the used printing program, a2ps
or enscript.<p>
<item><bf/a2ps/ Configures the printer for use with a2ps. See Printing for more information.<p>
<item><bf/enscript/ Configures the printer for use with enscript. See Printing for more information.<p>
<item><bf/Tools.../ Opens the Configure Tools dialog. Here, you can configure the "Tools" menu by adding or removing programs that will
be started in the Tools-window.<p>
<item><bf/KDevelop Setup/ Opens the KDevelop Setup dialog. The first tabulator configures general settings, followed by the
key-configuration and the Documentation settings. The Documentation settings also include the generation of a new set of
HTML-library documentation and the rebuilding of the search index for the Helpbrowser.
</itemize>
<p>
<sect2>The Window Menu<p>
The Window menu contains a list with all currently open files. This allows a quick swith to another file you're currently working
on.
<sect2>Managing Bookmarks<p>
The Bookmarks menu is intended for adding and removing bookmarks you want to set in the current editing file. As KDevelop uses two
editing windows, each one configures it's bookmarks seperately.
<itemize>
<item><bf/Set Bookmark/ Opens a context-menu with up to nine configurable bookmarks. This allows setting a bookmark to a certain entry
in the bookmarks menu by logical reasons.<p>
<item><bf/Add Bookmark/ Adds the line of the current cursor position to the bookmarks menu as a bookmark. Mind that this could
overwrite a bookmark set with the Set Bookmark-option.<p>
<item><bf/Clear Bookmarks / Clears the bookmark-entries for the top editing window, e.g. if the Header-Window is visible and you call
Clear Bookmarks, the entries for the Header-Window are deleted.<p>
<item><bf/Header-Window/ Contains the bookmark-list for the Header-Window. Selecting a bookmark will set the cursor to the selected
bookmarks' line. Mind that bookmarks are only assigned to the file they are set to, so if you change to another file, the
bookmarks are not deleted but choosing a bookmark won't change to the file they are assingned to as well.<p>
<item><bf>C/C++-Window</bf> Contains the bookmark-list for the C/C++-Window. The preferences are the same as for the
Header-Window.
</itemize>
<p>
<sect2>Online Help<p>
The Help-menu contains entries for navigating in the Helpbrowser as well as entries for library and online-documentation for the
most recently used cases. Accessing additional online-documentation can be achieved with the DOC-tree in the treeview
automatically opened (if Autoswitch is enabled) when changing to the Documentation Browser window.
<itemize>
<item><bf/Back / Opens the page opened before the actual one.<p>
<item><bf/Forward / Opens the next page of the browser-history, available after a "Back"-action.<p>
<item><bf/Search Marked Text		F2/ Scans the search-index for text currently marked in the editing windows or the browser-window. Afte
the search, a result page is shown which lets you select the help-page to switch to. After choosing a page, the browser will
highlight the found entry for the expression the search was invoked for. With the F3 key the next search result on the same page
will be displayed if more than one hit was reported for the search on one page.<p>
<item><bf/Search for Help on.../Opens the Search for Help on... dialog that lets you search for a specific expression you want help on.<p>
<item><bf/Contents		F1/ Opens the User's Manual to KDevelop index page so you have access to this manual.<p>
<item><bf/KDevelop Homepage/ Opens the KDevelop Homepage in the browser window if Internet access is provided.<p>

<sect>The Helpsystem<label id="The Helpsystem">
<p>
Most of KDevelop's strength is accumulated in the Helpsystem.  It is also to be understood as an example of how to extend your own
KDE application with a complete set of help functionality, and is, in part, already realized in the template applications, so
KDE/Qt application frameworks generated with the KAppWizard do already contain the basic functionality for statusbar help and
documentation, that only has to be extended by the programmer. This section therefore introduces into the usage of the general
help provided within the IDE as well as to show the usage of the Helpbrowser, which, by intelligent use, will make it very easy to
get the information you need for development.

<sect1>The "What's this ?"-Button and Quickhelp<p>
Looking at KDevelop's top toolbar, you will see the "What's this?" button on the right end. By selecting the button, the cursor
will change to a pointer with a question mark on the right, as is the same as the button in the toolbar. Now, you can select any
visible part of the KDevelop user interface and click on it. This will result in displaying a helpwindow giving you a short
description of the function this part gives you or what it can do for you. Included are the main view, the treeviews and the
toolbars, for which every button help is provided. After another mouseclick or a keyboard input, the What's this? help window
disappears and your cursor is set to the last active position. Mind, that, if you place the mousepointer over a button, it gets
raised and after a short time, you will get a QuickTip-window, describing the function the button represents in the menubar; this
will disappear if you move the mousepointer away.

For user interaction dialogs, Quickhelp provides you help windows with a short description of the selected item you want help for.
These are accessed by a right-button mouseclick to the item, a context-menu pops up that allows the selection of "Quick-Help".
Selecting this will pop up the help window. This is always useful for dialogs where you can't see the action's purpose for as long
as you are not familiar with KDevelop. Mind that most dialogs offer a Help-button which will show you the detailed context-help
for the dialog's options within the provided online-manual in the help-browser.

<sect1> The Statusbar Help<p>
The statusbar of KDevelop offers you many fuctions that inform you about the current activity state as well as "status messages"
offering a short description for commands.
<sect2> Statusbar Entries<p>
The Statusbar contains:
<enum>
<item> a general message field, mostleft. This is used for help messages and displays the current activity.
<item> the progressbar, indicating the progress for actions that require a comparably long time to be finished, such as saving
files and the scan-progress of the Classbrowser.
<item> an Insert/Overwrite indicator. It shows the editor mode for insert actions by INS for Insert mode and OVR for Overwrite
mode. The mode can be changed by the INS-key on the keyboard.
<item> a line counter, displaying the current line the cursor is placed.
<item> a column counter, indicating the current column position of the cursor in a line.
</enum>

<sect2> Help Messages<p>
The statusbar informs you about the action of menuentries if you select a menu within the menubar and select an action without
executing it. Further, if you press on a toolbar icon, but without releasing the mousebutton, the help message for the button is
displayed in the same way as for the menuentries. You can prevent the execution of the selected icon by moving the mousepointer
away from the icon, still hoding the button pressed. If the cursor is away, release the mousebutton.

For actions that are currently executed, KDevelop displays the action. This counts for processes running in the background
such as saving files as well as for dialogs. If the process has exited such as a make-invocation, the statusbar display
changes back to "Ready" state.

Also, when using the documentation browser, the statusbar displays link urls for as long as the cursor is placed over an URL link
in the browser window. Therefore, you can easily find out if the file is a local or a remote file only accessed by network
connection.

The caption of the KDevelop Project Editor shows you the currently opened filename in the top window. This would be a HTML file
for the documentation browser or a text file for the editing windows. Further, the Project name is displayed, so you have constant
control where you are and what you're currently working at.

<sect1> Using the Documentation Browser<label id="Using the Documentation Browser">
<p>
The documentation browser allows quick and easy access to all manuals and documentations that are provided with KDevelop or
generated automatically, including online-documentation for the KDE-libraries and your project documentation. Plus, the
Documentation Tree in the tree-view lets you customize a special "Others" folder that contains all individually added
documentation. <sect2>Requirements
<p>
To make use of all features of the Helpbrowser, you should have KDoc and glimpse installed. KDoc will generate all kind of online
classdocumentation for the KDE-libraries during the setup process, but can also invoked by option in the <ref id="KDevelop Setup"
name="KDevelop Setup">. For the generation of an API (Application Programming Interface) Documentation for your project's classes,
KDoc is also used and called by the Build-menu, entry "Make API-Doc". This will process all current header files of the project
plus the addition of a cross-reference to the Qt and KDE-libraries if those are available in the Helpbrowser. For the generation
of the project handbooks, you should have ksgml2html (provided with the KDE-SDK) and, as a minimum, SGML-tools installed on your
system. To extend and change your project's online-documentation, you have to edit the documentation file for your project by
selecting it in the RFV. After saving your changes, call "Make User-Manual" from the Build-menu. In case sgmltools detect
formatting errors, those will be displayed in the output window allow you to find the error line directly. The program "glimpse"
is used to create a personal search-index for your documentation automatically. The index is generally build during the
installation process, but can also be build with the <ref id="KDevelop Setup" name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog. For a description of
the provided search functions see <ref id="Using the Search Index" name="Using the Search Index">

<sect2>Provided Documentation
<p>
The KDevelop IDE comes with two sets of online-documentation, which can be accessed either via the Help-menu or by the Doc-tree in
the Tree-View in the KDevelop folder. The first book provided is this online-handbook containing all information you need towards
installation, configuration, available functionality and introduction to application development. The second book is "The KDevelop
Programming Handbook" in it's first edition. The programming handbook covers most questions related to the creation and extension
of projects that work with KDevelop. By tutorials the user gets an introduction to the rich facilities that applications created
with the Qt- and/or KDE-libraries have to offer as well as given a guideline for ensuring KDE-compliance, which covers the same
instructions given on the internet site of <htmlurl url="http://developer.kde.org" name="developer.kde.org">
However, the programming handbook cannot replace any additonal documentation available in printed or electronic form about the C++
programming language as well as about the usage of the Qt-library in certain terms.

The C/C++-Reference used with KDevelop is currently only available on the <htmlurl
url="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html" name="KDevelop homepage"> can be installed easily by downloading
and copying the sourcefile to the main KDE-directory ($KDEDIR). There, you only have to untar it with <tt/tar zxvf
c_c++_reference.tar.gz/, automatically placing it in the documentation directory of KDevelop. For uninstalling the reference
documentation you just have to delete the "reference" folder under ($KDEDIR)/share/doc/HTML/default/kdevelop/reference.

The Qt/KDE-libraries documentation folder allows direct access to the HTML-online documentation of your copy of the Qt-library.
The path to the library documentation is usually automatically detected by the KDevelop installation program, but can be set
manually in the <ref id="KDevelop Setup" name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog. Also, all available documentation for the KDE-libraries
are listed in order of the library name, so if you would use classes of a certain library it is easy to determine the library type
to be added to the linker settings in the project. Mind that the whole KDE-library documentation is only accessable when generated
by KDoc- so this program, included in the KDE-SDK, has to be installed before the documentation can be generated. As the
installation program of KDevelop does this automatically, it should be installed before KDevelop is started for the first time. If
this is not the case and the documentation cannot be build, you are able to create it afterwards at any time with the <ref
id="KDevelop Setup" name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog.

The library documentation tree is followed by the "Others" folder which is inteded to contain all personally customized
documentation as described below. Finally, the Doc-Tree allows access to the Project API and the Project Manual for your current
project.

<sect2>Adding Documentation to the Helpbrowser
<p>
To customize your Helpbrowser, open the Tree-View and select the "DOC" Tabulator. You will see an opened tree called
Documentation, containing four folders. The "Others" folder is, by default, empty. On a right mousebutton click over this folder,
a context menu opens that has an entry "Add Entry". Select this to open the Add Entry dialog where you have to enter two values:
the upper one for the name that will be displayed for the documentation within the Doc-tree, and, below that, a file-entry line.
Here, you have to enter the path and filename to the startpage that will be opened by the selection of the entry later. You can
enter the path and filename directly or by selection of the pushbutton on the right to open a file-chooser dialog. This allows a
quick browsing on your system to the path for your startpage. Mind that only HTML-documentation can be selected, so only HTML
files are allowed to choose. Selecting OK will add the entry to the Doc-tree and is available directly.

<sect2>Using the Search Index<label id="Using the Search Index">
<p>
KDevelop includes a set of fuctions to help you search information within HTML documentation. To use these features, your system
needs to have the program "glimpse", a free database generator, installed, which creates the search index and executes searches
within the documentation. To set up the index, see <ref id="KDevelop Setup" name="KDevelop Setup">, but the index is also
automatically generated during the installation program.

The search functions are available through several ways which you can choose from:
<enum>
<item>in the editor, select the text you want to have help on or place the cursor in the word that you want to look for. Then
press the right mouse button and select look up: "expression" This can also be done by selecting "Search Marked Text" from the
help menu, the shorcut key F2 or by selecting the Search icon from the toolbar.
<item>in the Documentation browser select the text you want to look up and press the right mouse button, select look
up:"expression" or select "Search Marked Text" or the search icon as above.
<item>if you want to search for a specific keyword, select "Search for Help on..." in the help menu or select the "Search for Help
on..." icon from the toolbar, opening a search dialog where you can enter the expression you want to get information for.
</enum>
Direct access to specific documentation is given by selecting the according icon in the "DOC" -tree-view or by the help menu
entries.

<sect>Working with the Editor<label id="Working with the Editor">
<sect1> Editor
<p>
The integrated editor of KDevelop is based on KWrite, known as the "Extended Editor"  in KDE-1.1. The options dialog configures
the main behavoir for the editor regarding things as selections, wrapping etc.
<bf>Edit Options:</bf>
<bf>Auto Indent:</bf>									this sets the edior to place the cursor below the first literal when a new line is entered.
<bf>Backspace Indent:</bf>							this option sets the cursor below the first literal of the line above when backspace is pressed.
<bf>Word Wrap:</bf>										words are taken into the next line after the column set in "Wrap Words At:"

<bf>Replace Tabs:</bf>									tabulators in the current text are replaced with tabulators of the "Tab Width:" value

<bf>Remove Trailing Spaces:</bf>				removes trailing spaces

<bf>Wrap Cursor:</bf>									sets the cursor to the end of the last line when backspace enters the beginning of a line

<bf>Auto Brackets:</bf>								creates a closing bracket in front of the cursor when a bracket (any kind) is opened.

<bf>Select Options:</bf>

<bf>Persistent Selections:</bf>        selections made stay marked after setting the cursor to a different place

<bf>Multiple Selections:</bf>          allows multiple independent selections within the text

<bf>Vertical Selections:</bf>          when selecting multiple lines, the selection is also made horizontal and doesn't cover the
whole line
<bf>Delete On Input:</bf>              deletes a selection when writing in the selection.

<bf>Toggle Old:</bf>                   allows only one selection. A selection made gets deselected when another selection is made.

<bf>Wrap Words At:</bf>                sets the maximum


<sect1> Editor Colors<p>
The editor allows to configure the general view of the editing field by choosing colors for:
<itemize>
<item> background:              the editor's background
<item> text background:       	the background of displayed text
<item> selected:                the color of selected text to display the selection
<item> found:                   the color of text found by a search via the menu "View"-"Search", "Repeat search" and "Replace".
<item> selected + found:        the color of text selected to search for and found
</itemize>

<sect1> Editor Defaults<p>
The Editor Defaults dialog lets you configure the default values for language items such as keywords etc. and the default font
style.  When setting up the syntax highlighting (see below), those default values can be used to configure standard values
configured here.

<sect1> Syntax-Highlighting<p>
    The Syntax-Highlighting configurations dialog allows settings for different programming languages and fonts, each independent.
To change the preset syntax-highlighting for a language, choose the language and the idiom wich display type you want to change.

KDevelop creates a projectfile with the .kdevprj ending. This file contains all your project information, so be careful not to
delete it. It is stored in the project's base directory and has to be opened to load the project. The projectfile keeps all
information for your files like the file properties, install path, distribution status and compiler options (CXXFLAGS). Setting
file properties allows you to keep track of where the files should go.

With KAppWizard, you can create a new application project according to your choice of application type. For now, KAppWizard
generates three kinds of fram applications, as:

<item>a single document interface (SDI) KDE-application including a menubar, a toolbar and a statusbar. It contains basic control
resource management to allow extending the frame application into a unique KDE 1.1 application. The application frame also
contains statusbar help messages as known from commercial products just like KDevelop itself. From the programmer's point of view,
it is based on three application-specific classes leaning on the MVC-concept (Model-View-Controller). Technically, the base
classes may not be viewed that way, but it's construction is at least created most logical to create applications with a GUI.

<item>a KDE-based application frame window. This application type offers most flexibility to those wanting to develop their
program from scratch, but can also be used as a basis for developing wizard applications or modules.

<item>a Qt-only based program framework. For those programmers who want to use the Qt library as the GUI interface alone, we
tried to offer you a smart framework to support your application development. As Qt programming is fully supported, you should
have no problems to create a full-functional application by using Qt only.

<item>a C++ program framework. This application type is intended for those wanting to write a terminal based C++ program. Just
remove the "Hello World" line in main() and construct your classes the same way with KDevelop as for KDE applications.
</itemize>
For importing existing applications, we suggest using the New Project option. Select "Project" from the menubar and select "New".
The New Project dialog offers creates a project directory and subdirectories as well as the project file with the project name and
type. We advise copying all needed creation files like configure.in, Makefile.am's etc. into the project directory from your
existing project and choose "Project"->"Add file(s)"->"Add existing file(s)" to copy the sources into your new project directory.
Note that your Makefile.am's will be changed by KDevelop and you probably will have to change or delete some entries to provide
clean compilation. You should not edit the KDevelop write area, instead you should read the entries made by KDevelop and delete
matching titles created yourself. Also note that only one project is supported to work on at the moment, so your source files
should be in the project's subdirectory which has the same name as the main project directory. In the Logical File Viewer the
groups have to be set by yourself if you chose to use that importing possibility. Another way could be to create a frame
application and delete the created source and header files. Then you can add existing files as above.

<sect2>Creating Libraries
<p>
This type of project isn't supported at the moment. This will be another feature planned to be integrated in later versions of
KDevelop.

<sect1> New Projects with KAppWizard<p>

The KDevelop Application Wizard allows the creation of four different types of projects, constructing a framework for each. All
projects are FSF-compliant and use the GNU standard development tools as described in the requirements section of this handbook.

For KDE applications, the wizard offers two different frameworks, the KDE-Application, providing a complete application with base
classes for document type, view and application. This includes the creation of a menubar, toolbar and statusbar, the mainwindow
inherits the KTMainWindow class. The KDE-Mini-Application only gives a view which is empty. This type of project can be used for
the creation of small desktop tools or other simple applications without too much change on the existing code provided by the
framework. A Qt-Application offers the creation of a Qt-only program if you wish no dependencies towards the KDE-libraries for
end-users. (NOTE: The configure script still checks for the KDE-libraries.  This will be fixed in the next version of KDevelop).	

The Qt-Application also is created by using tree base classes like the KDE-standard-Application and provides a menubar, toolbar
and statusbar.

The C++ -Application type offers a framework for creating commandline applications.  It is ready to run and by default displays
"Hello World" as the only action.  This may be useful for C++ learners who would like to program applications without using a GUI
first or for those working on commandline programs written in C++ or C.

The wizard asks for your project name, version and the location where the project directory will be build.  Furher, your Name and
Email adress are asked for inserting them in header and cpp templates on top of your source files as well as for entries in the
*.lsm file.


<sect1> Porting existing projects<p>

Existing projects can be converted to KDevelop projects by selecting "New" from the project menu.  The following dialog creates an
empty project file with your project name, version and type information as well as your name and email adress.  Then copy all your
compilation and construction files to the new project directory and choose "Add Files" from the project menu.  The files selected
will be copied into your project directory and the makefile.am's are updated.   Please change all Makefile.am entries existing
before the conversion towards the now created entries done by KDevelop in the KDevelop area.  Test, if your program can still be
compiled and installed after the conversion to ensure the project's consistancy.



<sect1>Adding Files and Classes<p>
Adding a new file is often used when you think that you should separate your class implementation file into several ones. Then you
need to create an new file which will get the part of the class implementation you want to move. You can specify which type the
new file will be, including a template for pixmap files often needed to create new toolbar icons. The new file will be added to
the project and all affected project files like Makefile.am etc will be updated.

<sect1>Generating new Classes<p>

<sect1>Adding Translations<p>

<sect1>Extending the Project Documentation<p>

<sect1>Setting Project File Options<p>
The file properties dialog can be accessed via the project menu or within the LFV by a right mouseclick.  It shows the project
files in groups as they are sorted in the LFV and displays the file properties like file size, file type and if the file is
included in the project as well as the installation path if the file is going to be installed by the end-user's make install
command.  It is important for documentation files as well as pixmaps to specify the location where the files should go when the
project is build and installed by end users, so you have to set up those locations.   For standard KDE location macros you should
look in your Makefile.am where the location macros are specified.

<sect1> General Project Options<p>

The Project Options dialog , accessed by the project menu, lets you specify all needed parameters for your project. Those will be
updated in the makefile.am's and the configure.in script (e.g. version number change or compiler warnings ).  After changing the
project options, you should invoke "make clean" or "rebuild all" to compile your project with the new options.  Please mind that
debugging is only available if the project options are set to create debugging information, the amount can be set with the debug
level (0-3). If you add functions that belong to a library that is not included in the linker flags, your program will not link
correctly if those are not updated, so keep track of your library linking.

<sect>General Configuration<label id="General Configuration">
<sect1> Documentation Browser<p>
    The Documentation Browser can be configured by this menu,setting colors for HTML links, background etc.
Also the font size can be changed as well as the fixed and standard font type according to the system's installed fonts.


<sect1> Printer Setup<p>
The printer can be configured to use the printing programs a2ps and enscript, so please make sure that either one of them is
installed on your system. The configuration is almost similar for both programs, but the options must be set differently by
using the corresponding configuration dialogs.


<sect1> KDevelop Setup<label id="KDevelop Setup">
<p>
<sect2> General
<p>
<bf>Make-command:</bf>
The General Options dialog lets you configure KDevelop's general settings.
First, you should set the make-command available on your system. If the selected program does not exist,
KDevelop will warn you the next time your're invoking a make command.

<bf>Autosave:</bf>

If Autosave is checked, KDevelop will save all changed files periodically.  The autosaving time range can be set to 3, 5, 15 or 30 minutes.


<bf>Autoswitch:</bf>

If Autoswitch is enabled, the KDevelop windows will switch on and off according to the usage context, e.g.  if you switch to a
documentation in the Helpmenu, the Documentation browser will be opened, together with the documentation tree and the output
window turned off.
Startup:

For starting KDevelop, you have the option to enable/disable the startlogo to be shown during the time KDevelop loads.
Further, if you don't like the last project to be opened on startup, you can disable the default behavoir.


<sect2>Changing Keyboard Shortcuts <label id="Changing Keyboard Shortcuts">
<p>
The Configure Keys dialog lets you configure the KDevelop key bindings. Note that global keys can be configured in the
KDE Control Center, such as open file and print.  A key function can be configured by choosing the menu entry. Then the
configuration can be changed by checking values like the Alt / Ctrl key etc.


<sect2> Documentation<p>
<sect3> Directories<p>

For setting up the documentation browser to work correctly, KDevelop needs some information about where the HTML- documentation
is placed on the system. Therefore, the Documentation Path properties dialog needs the path of the Qt- online documentation in HTML
as well as the path to the KDE-library documentation.

Usually, the Qt-documentation is placed in the same directory where Qt is installed; e.g. if Qt resides in /usr/local/qt, the path
you have to enter is /usr/local/qt/html. For the KDE- Documentation, you have to set the directory to the root of the
documentation, assumed all KDE-Libs documentation resides in the same directory. Both path's can be selected by pressing the
according buttons, displaying a path-selection. If your system doesn't contain the documentation for the KDE-libs,  you should
first enter the next configuration dialog, Update KDE-Documentation. This will create the documentation to a path of your choice,
also setting the KDE Library Doc path automatically.

<sect3> Options<p>
<sect4> Update KDE-Documentation
<p>
For those users who don't have a recent documentation of the KDE-libraries, especially the documentation for the files
installed on the system, the Update KDE-Documentation dialog creates a new one or updates existing documentations. This
function requires your system to have kdoc and qt2kdoc installed, included in the kdesdk package. First of, you have to set
up the path to your recent kdelibs sources, which is not the include-path for KDE ! Just enter the path to the sources, like:
/home/rnolden/kdelibs-1.1/.

Then, you can choose three different installation modes, as:

<itemize>
<item> Delete old Documentation and  install to recent Documentationpath:  this assumes that youalready have a documentation
installed and is placed in the path the Documentation Path-dialog was entered. This will delete all documentation and install the
newly generated documentation into the recent path.
<item> Delete old Documentation and install to new Documentationpath:   this will result in deleting the old documentation as
well as above, but gives you the choice to set up a new documentation place.
<item> Leave old Documentation untouched and install to new Documentation path:   This is recommended for a new generation of
the kdelibs documentation for users who didn't have one before and for those who want to keep the last documentation for an older
kdelibs version.
</itemize>

The "new KDE Libs Documentation path" is to be set  for option 2 and 3 of the installation mode.  This is also recommended for
users who generate a new documentation from scratch.

After pressing the OK button, KDevelop will create a subdirectory "kdoc-reference" in the documentation path containing the kdoc
reference files.  First, the qt library documentation classes will be indexed to connect the Qt documentation with the
documentation to be generated for the kdelibs.  So it is important that you have set up the Qt documentation path first to ensure
that it can be found by qt2kdoc. Finally, the KDE libs will be indexed and the documentation will be build with crossreferences to
give browsing the most functionality.

<sect4>Create Search Database
<p>
The Create Search Database dialog, accessed via the create-button, allows the programmer to create a database to search for a
keyword interactively.  To create and use the documentation search function, you must have the program glimpse 4.1 installed.
Preset are the options to index the given KDE-library documentation as well as the Qt-documentation, assuming the path to the
documentation files were set in the "Documentation Path" dialog of the options- menu.   Additionally, the index can include
directories the user can set up himself by the "additional directories to index"-field.  After setting a path to an addional
directory, the "Add" - button must be pushed to set the path.  A path once set can be removed from the index by selecting the path
in the path field and pushing "Remove". Furthermore, the user is offered three different modes for the index size: tiny, small and
medium.  The higher the index size, the more the index files will grow. On the other hand, a search in a bigger searchdatabase
will be faster and more successful, so we suggest choosing a "medium" size. For using the search function, see section
Using the Documentation Browser

<sect>Questions and Answers<label id="Questions and Answers">
<p>
<bf>Q:</bf> I have a question which is not adressed in the FAQ file, nor in the manuals of KDevelop. Where should I turn to ?

<bf>A:</bf>  In any case send all requests that are regarding KDevelop to the KDevelop mailinglist which adress can be found on the
KDevelop homepage. All questions should go there and will be adressed there as well.  If you stick to that, you will get the most
help by the developers and all users having the same problems, as well as helping to keep the FAQ up to date.

<bf>Q:</bf> Wrong JPEG library version: library is 61, caller expects 62

<bf>A:</bf>  There are 2 ways.
<enum>
<item> When the kdelibs are installed it installs header files for the
 jpeg libraries, these are version 61,  however most distributions
 (Redhat) use version 62 libraries. To fix  this just remove jpeglib.h
 from /opt/kde/include. The pukka include  file for version 62 should
 then be picked up. However looking at the  error message above it may
 be the other way round, in any case ensure  you only have on version
 of the header file, the library and that  they are consistent.

 It is useful to use the locate command to verify that I have
 the correct version of a library and header files e.g.
 updatedb
 locate libjpeg
 locate jpeglib

<item> You must recompiled kdesupport without jpeg
 library (./configure --with-libjpeg --with-libgif).
</enum>


<bf>Q:</bf>
 <tscreen><verb>make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/local/src/kdevelop-0.3/po'
 cd .. && automake --gnu --include-deps po/Makefile
 aclocal.m4: 2709: `AM_PROG_INSTALL' is obsolete; use `AC_PROG_INSTALL'
 make[2]: *** [Makefile.in] Error 1
</verb></tscreen>
<bf>A:</bf>  Workaround for automake-1.4/automake-2.13 users: Just run
 "aclocal" manually, then it will compile.


<bf>Q:</bf>  What must i do, if configure said ,that i need giflib23.

<bf>A:</bf>  Try a newer snap of kdesupport, or maybe you have another giflib installed?


<bf>Q:</bf> How can I convert a KDevelop 0.2 project to a 0.3 one?

<bf>A:</bf> Please change the AC_OUTPUT in the configure.in to a oneline version

 for example:
 old version:
<tscreen><verb>
AC_OUTPUT(Makefile \
kdevelop/kwrite/Makefile \
kdevelop/templates/Makefile
)
</verb></tscreen>
 new version:
<tscreen><verb>

<bf>A:</bf> If you have the SuSE rpms of KDE-1.1, you must recompile the kdelibs without the patch commited by SuSE and reinstall
them or get an updated rpm of the kdelibs from <htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.suse.com" name="ftp://ftp.suse.com">

<bf>Q:</bf> I see the KDevelop does not allow for usage of the delete key (or backspace deleting when text is marked).

<bf>A:</bf>  go to "Options"->"Editor" and make sure that "Delete on Input" is enabled, then backspace and delete works.


<bf>Q:</bf> If I add files to my project, will they be automatically included and compiled ?

<bf>A:</bf> Yes, they are included in the Makefile.am's then and if you make a "Rebuild All" (./configure updates the Makefiles), your new
added files will be included as well.

<bf>Q:</bf> If I removed a file, I get some weird linker messages. What is wrong with my project ?

<bf>A:</bf> If the removed file is a header file, that is automatically processed by automoc (running the Qt-Meta-Object-Compiler
automatically on all headers), your removed header is still present as a moc-generated *.moc.cpp file and compiled.  Remove the
according *.moc.cpp file and rebuild the project. >

<sect>Thanks<p>

We like to express special thanks to all of our family members and friends who supported us in several ways to let us construct
and improve KDevelop.

Further, we thank  Jochen Wilhelmy  for offering his program kwrite and his help on integrating it into KDevelop.

Thanks also to the KDE team and Stephan Kulow, who gave us the possibility to work on KDevelop via CVS

We hope that our free work on this product will lead to a better acceptance of Free Software and its development. Without the help
and idealism of many, the KDevelop IDE would never have been realized in such a short period of time and we're proud that so many
users already have reported good experience and brought KDevelop to it's destiny: helping free software programmers to build a
better world where users have the freedom of choice.
