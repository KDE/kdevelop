<sect>Introduction
<p>
As everything on earth has it's fashions, today's computer world seems to tend more to the use of free software even for
commercial purpose. The most popular free software project is Linux. It is now generally agreed that Linux, (as well as other projects
such as the Apache web server, the Perl language and GNU suite of tools), proves that free software can be of as high a quality as
commercial software. But despite the quality, end users must still suffer under the cryptic commands of any Unix Systems.For Linux to
thrive, it needs applications, both free and commercial, and ease of use.

The <idx/KDE/ project tries to close this gap by providing an easy to use desktop and the companion libraries to extend the variety of
available GUI-based software. But especially as free software is often made in the author's free time, the question for many
programmers is how much they like the current code development environment. KDevelop wants to take another major step: making the
programmer's life easier and more efficient: products created with KDevelop can reach a higher level of reliability and functionality
in the same development period.

To fulfill this goal, the KDevelop Integrated Development Environment provides many features that developers need as well as it
wraps the functionality of third party projects such as <tt/make/ and the GNU C++ compilers and makes them an invisible, integrated
part of the development process. KDevelop manages:

<itemize>
<item> All development tools needed for C++ programming like compiler, linker, automake and
autoconf,
<item> KAppWizard, which generates complete, ready-to-go sample applications,
<item> Classgenerator, for creating new classes and integrating them into the current project,
<item> Rile management for sources, headers, documentation etc. to be included in the project,
<item> The creation of User-Handbooks written with SGML and the automatic generation of HTML-output with the KDE look and feel,
<item> Automatic HTML-based API-documentation for your project's classes with cross-references to the used libraries,
<item> Internationalization support for your application, allowing translators to easily add their target language to a project,
<item> WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) -creation of user interfaces with a built-in dialog editor,
<item> Debugging your application by integrating KDbg,
<item> Editing of project-specific pixmaps with KIconedit,
<item> The inclusion of any other program you need for development by adding it to the "Tools"-menu according to your individual needs.
</itemize>

KDevelop makes it a joy to work with all programs in one place and saves time by automating standard development processes
as well as giving you direct and transparent access to all information you need. The integrated browsing mechanisms are designed
to support documentation requests that developers have in conjunction with their project.

The class viewer and error finder bring you anywhere in the project code with a mouse click without needing to search for files; File
trees give direct access to the project files and the integrated help system offers superb access to online-documentation from anywhere
within the IDE.

<sect1>Changes
<p>
Since the last release, the main work was done in three different areas: the class viewer, the dialog editor and the
"look-n'-feel" in general, including new editing functions and the creation of <idx/KDE/-applications. In order to accomplish all this,
we are proud to welcome the newest two team members, Jonas Nordin, who designed a full-featured class parser and -viewer, and Pascal
Krahmer, who joined the team to implement an integrated dialog editor. Other work was done in various parts of the IDE, such as a new
<tt/grep/-dialog allowing expression search through all project files or even the whole system; extended configuration
utilities; reviewed and extended documentation as well as a new project generator.

<sect1>About this Handbook
<p>
This user manual gives the user a complete overview of the KDevelop IDE and describes the basic development process in brief. For more
information about specific programming issues, we suggest reading the KDevelop Programming Handbook included with KDevelop, which
covers themes such as understanding generated application frameworks and how to create full-featured <idx/KDE/ applications using
example projects.

The design of this handbook is therefore separated into the following parts:
<itemize>
<item>Chapter <ref id="Installation" name="Installation">, covers the system requirements, installation and setting up of the KDevelop
IDE. <item>Chapter <ref id="Programs" name="Programs">, tells you how programs are created with standard GNU development tools and
how they are built.
<item>Chapter <ref id="Development with KDevelop" name="Development with KDevelop">, takes you on a short tour describing the
main functionality of the environment.
<item>Chapter <ref id="Overview" name="Overview">, explains the menus and dialogs as well as keyboard shortcuts.
<item>Chapter <ref id="The Help System" name="The Help System">, shows how to use the built-in documentation browser and
additional help functions.
<item>Chapter  <ref id="Working with the Editor" name="Working with the Editor">, explains the features of file management and
editing.
<item>Chapter <ref id="Projects" name="Projects">, describes the creation and maintaining of software projects.
<item>Chapter <ref id="Build Settings" name="Build Settings">, contains a reference on how to set compiler and liker flags as well as project options.
<item>Chapter <ref id="The Class Browser" name="The Class Browser">, tells you how to make use of KDevelop's powerful Class Browser.
<item>Chapter <ref id="The Dialog Editor" name="The Dialog Editor">, features the integrated visual GUI constructor and how it
generates C++ output.
<item>Chapter <ref id="General Configuration" name="General Configuration"> shows how you can set overall preferences for using KDevelop.
<item>Chapter <ref id="Questions and Answers" name="Questions and Answers">, covers questions that regard to the usage of KDevelop
under different flavors of Unix systems and problem solutions in general.
</itemize>

For programming beginners and new users of this product we recommend to read yourself into this manual before starting to actually
work with the IDE as it covers the usage in depth. The understanding of how things are done the quickest way will save you a lot
of time searching for functions and features as it will enable you to make use of first-class development tools even more simple.

<sect>Installation<label id="Installation">
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain KDevelop
<p>
KDevelop can be found either on the <idx/KDE/ Applications page (<htmlurl url="http://www.kde.org/current.html"
name="http://www.kde.org/current.html">) or on the KDevelop homepage (<htmlurl
url="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html" name="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html">).
KDevelop is also available on Linux distributions, such as SuSE 6.1.

We're offering weekly snapshots of the KDevelop CVS repository on our homepage for those who want to stay up to date with
KDevelop. Usually, the snapshots are not intended to be used for production but as a test for new features and to give an insight
into development progress of the KDevelop team. Also we offer various third party software needed by KDevelop directly such as
KDoc and KDbg.

If you're experiencing problems with compiling or using KDevelop, please read the <ref id="Questions and Answers" name="Questions and
Answers"> section of this handbook or the FAQ-file included with the KDevelop package. If your problem is not addressed, please
subscribe to the KDevelop mailinglist at <htmlurl url="mailto:kdevelop@fara3.cs.uni-potsdam.de" name =
"kdevelop@fara3.cs.uni-potsdam.de"> by sending a mail with an empty header and "subscribe" as contents. Requests and problem report
should only target the usage of the KDevelop IDE and not towards any questions that regard any implementation problem you may have
while coding your own application. Anyway, all mails send to the mailinglist should be written in English, so that all participants can
take part on discussions and are able to provide better help. The mailinglist is also intended for those users willing to contribute
and who found solutions for any problems they experienced, so we can fix errors and include that knowledge to give beginners an even
more qualified first-hand help.
An good way to report problems is to send the output you get by starting kdevelop from the console or to copy and paste the
contents of KDevelop's internal Messages-window.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile and use KDevelop, you need the following programs and libraries.
<p>
<bf>Required:</bf>
<itemize>
<item>gcc/g++ 2.7.2.1 (or compatible)
<item>perl 5.004
<item>autoconf 2.12
<item>automake 1.2
<item>Qt 1.42
<item><idx/KDE/ 1.1
</itemize>
<p>
<bf>Optional:</bf>
<itemize>
<item>a2ps or enscript for printing support
<item>ghostview or kghostview for printing preview
<item>glimpse 4.0 for the search index
<item>sgmltools 1.0
<item><idx/KDE-SDK/ (<bf/KDE S/oftware <bf/D/evelopment <bf/K/it)with KDoc, KSgml2Html, KTranslator (available at <htmlurl
url="http://developer.kde.org" name="http://developer.kde.org">)
<item>KDbg, KIconEdit (available at <htmlurl url="http://www.kde.org" name="http://www.kde.org">)
</itemize>

KDevelop was tested with SuSE Linux 5.2 on an AMD K6 200, 64MB RAM and FreeBSD 3.0-Release as well as SuSE Linux 6.0 on an Intel
200 MMX, 128MB RAM.

<bf>Documentation:</bf>	

For creating the <idx/KDE/ library documentation, you need the kdelibs package in source available on your
system as provided by the KDE project or included with the source packages of your distribution and <bf>KDoc</bf> (included in the
<idx/KDE-SDK/).

Also we're offering a C/C++ Reference on our homepage at <htmlurl url="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html"
name="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html"> that is integrated into the documentation browser after it's
installation. Download the package and copy the source file as <tt/root/ into your <idx/KDE/ directory and untar it with <tt/tar zxvf
c_c++_reference.tar.gz/, then the reference is available in the documentation tree; otherwise selecting the reference book in the
browser shows an error page with the KDevelop homepage URL offering a download and describes the installation process.
<sect1>Compilation and Installation
<p>
In order to compile and install KDevelop on your system, type the following in the base directory of the KDevelop distribution:

<tscreen><verb>
	&percnt ./configure
	&percnt make

	(as root)
	
	&percnt make install
</verb></tscreen>


<p>Since KDevelop uses <tt>autoconf</tt> you should have not trouble compiling it.

In order to compile the KDevelop CVS snapshot, type the following :
<tscreen><verb>
	&percnt make -f Makefile.cvs
	&percnt ./configure
	&percnt make

	change as `root` and type:
	
	&percnt make install
</verb></tscreen>

If your system's make-command is <tt/gmake/, type <tt/gmake/ instead of <tt/make/.

<sect1>Starting KDevelop
<p>
If you use <idx/KDE/ as your window manager, KDevelop can be started either with choosing "K"&rarr"Applications"&rarr"KDevelop". As
KDevelop supports <idx/KDE/-Mime-types, you can also start by selecting a KDevelop project file ("*.kdevprj", displayed with the
KDevelop project icon) in the <idx/KDE/ File Manager which will start KDevelop and load the project.

Under other window managers, open a console and type:
<tscreen><verb>
&percnt kdevelop
</verb></tscreen>

Starting KDevelop with a certain project would be to change into the project-directory and to type:
<tscreen><verb> 	
&percnt kdevelop  &lt;yourProject&gt;.kdevprj
</verb></tscreen>

Under each user account KDevelop will invoke the <ref id="The Installation Program" name="automatic installation"> process on the
first start, allowing a quick configuration of the most needed options. If your installation is messed up, please delete your
kdeveloprc file and restart KDevelop, the automatic installation will be called again to set up KDevelop according to your system.

<sect1>The Installation Program<label id="The Installation Program">
<p>
KDevelop includes an automatic installation program module, which is invoked when starting the first time under the current
user account; meaning that the user's configuration file does not exist.  We advise following the installation steps by choosing
"Proceed" to automatically check your system and to set up your KDevelop environment.

The Installation dialog's buttons execute the following actions:
<p>
<bf>Help:</bf>  Will open  the KDEHelp program and open this page.
<p>
<bf>Proceed:</bf>  This will actually start the installation process and execute actions in the following order:

<enum>
<item> Checking for make/gmake, autoconf, autoheader, automake and perl for the creation and compilation of new applications
generated by KDevelop. If gmake is installed, the make-command will be set automatically to use gmake.  Other comandline options
to your make program can be set in the setup dialog accessed by the options menu later.

<item> Checking for KDoc and Glimpse.  Those will allow to create a new <idx/KDE-library/ documentation and a search index
automatically in a later setup step if found.

<item> Checking for a2ps and enscript to ensure that printing is available.  Either one of these programs have to be installed to
allow correct printing.

<item> Checking for KDbg,KIconedit and KTranslator.  We advise to install those programs as they are good
helpers to create complete <idx/KDE/-applications. Note that KDbg is used directly for debugging your current project within KDevelop;
KIconedit is used to display and edit pixmaps selected in the file-viewer trees. The programs KDbg, KIconedit and KTranslator are
then configured to be available in the "Tools" menu of the KDevelop menu bar if they are found. Other tools can be added to the
Tools-menu by selecting "Tools..." in the Options menu later.

<item> Showing the summary dialog.  All tested programs are listed with found or not found, additional hints are given, if a
needed program is recommended.

<item> Then follows the detection of your Qt-online documentation path.  This checks for several standard path in your system for
the documentation and sets the path automatically.  If your Qt-Documentation could not be found, a message will appear that asks
you to set the correct path or to continue.  Choosing to set the path will return to the main installation window and shows an
editing field with a button on the right of it.  Choosing this button will open a directory selection dialog, where you can
switch to the directory the documentation is located. Usually this is in the qt/html directory. After doing so, the installation
can continue with the selection of "Proceed" again.

<item> If KDoc was detected, you are asked to create/update your <idx/KDE/-library documentation.  For that, you need to have the
kde-libraries in source form. For Linux-Users who have installed <idx/KDE/ from a distribution, we advise to copy and extract the
source of the kdelibs-package to your system; Free BSD users who installed the kdelibs as a package should look for their according
distfile package of the ports-collection.   If none of these cases can be fulfilled, you should download the sources from
<htmlurl url="http://www.kde.org" name="http://www.kde.org"> and untar the sources on your system to create a documentation.  If
you wish to use the documentation package provided by <htmlurl url="http://developer.kde.org" name="http://developer.kde.org">,
you can cancel the creation and continue with creating the search index. Mind that the path to your kde-library documentation has
to be set manually in the setup dialog accessed by the options menu then.

<item> The "Update <idx/KDE/-Library documentation" dialog is set up to use a default path for the location of the documentation
to create in $(HOME)/.kde/share/apps/kdevelop/KDE-Documentation.  The only thing you have to do is choosing the path to your
library sources with the selection button on top of the dialog and press OK. If the path was set correctly, you are asked if your
documentation should be created using the khtml  or the khtmlw library.  We advise to use khtml as khtmlw is older and exists for
compatibility reasons. New applications using HTML widgets should use khtml.  To avoid confusion while programming, we decided to
only include one of those for documentation.  If you are working on applications that use khtmlw, you should create a different
documentation with the <ref id="General Configuration" name="KDevelop Setup"> in the options menu and use khtmlw then.    During
the creation of the documentation, a message in the installation window shows that it is in progress and you should wait for the
next message.
<p>
<bf>NOTE:</bf> On a multi-user system or systems with disk-quotas for user accounts, the creation of a complete HTML documentation
for each user would be a mere waste of disk space. In this case, ask you system administrator to run KDevelop under the
root account to allow write access to the system's root directory. Then create the documentation within the
<idx/KDE/-directory, under $KDEDIR/share/apps/kdevelop/KDE-Documentation. The correct path can then be set up later in the KDevelop
setup dialog, available in the "Options"-menu.

<item> If the system check found the Glimpse program on your system, you are offered to create a search database. The
search database can be created with the options of including the KDE-documentation and the Qt-documentation (default). Additionally
the online documentation of KDevelop is included and will be indexed.  If you have other documentation that should be indexed you
can select the directories and add them to the indexing process as well. If you wish to have direct access to these
documentations, you have to add them to the documentation tree later in KDevelop by a right-button click on the "Others" folder,
offering the addition of other documentations.

<item> During the creation of the search index, the installation window will show a message that this is in progress.

<item> If all installation steps were done correctly,  a final message shows that KDevelop will be started
after pressing OK and you are ready to start. Mind that you can set up additional options like auto saving in the
<ref id="General Configuration" name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog that can be accessed by the options menu.
</enum>

<bf>Cancel:</bf>  Will show a warning message that the installation process is going to be canceled.  This warning message allows to
return to the installation ("Back") or to start KDevelop with the default values ("Continue"). Mind that in this case you have to
set all options yourself with the configuration dialogs provided in the options-menu.

<sect>Programs<label id="Programs">
<p>
Now that KDevelop installed successfully and the most commonly used options are set, you are probably wondering if it keeps what
it promises. This Chapter gives you a guideline to how programs are created using the GNU tools in general and especially what
part KDevelop plays in this game.
<sect1>The Compiler<label id="The Compiler">
<p>
The compiler is actually the program on your system that has to be installed as a minimum to create running programs; he is the
one that compiles the source code into object files and creates the program.

Normally, you would start like this:
Open an editor of your choice - don't use a word-processor. Type in something like this to create the source for your first
program:

<tscreen><verb>
#include <iostream.h>

int main(){

cout << "Hello World" << endl;

}
</verb></tscreen>
Well, actually all the program will do is to print out the string "Hello World" to your standard output. But this is just the
source code for the program to be build, not the program itself. Therefore, we need a compiler, in this case a C++-compiler like
g++. Then we can save the file with the source code, as, let's say, myprogram.cpp and invoke the compiler with the filename
(on a console):

<tscreen><verb>
g++ -o myprogram myprogram.cpp
</verb></tscreen>
Then we can start our program- just type <tt/myprogram/  on the console, and the program prints out the string; then exits.

<sect1>Make and Makefiles<label id="Make">
<p>
I have everything I need: an editor, a compiler and I can execute my own C++ program. But it isn't all that easy. What happens if
you have more than one source file ? And, do you have to compile all sources over and over again only if you changed one file ?
Compiling will become more and more complicated and time-consuming, because you have to type in all the commands and options
yourself. Therefore, you could write a so-called "Makefile". You could also call it some other name except the name of the program
to build. Then, you should have the tool <tt/make/ or <tt/gmake/ installed, or any other tool that is capable of keeping track of
a project's compilation. Insert all your compiler commands in a certain syntax into that Makefile and save it; then you will only
have to type <tt/make/ or <tt/gmake/ on the console in the directory where your Makefile is located, and then make takes over,
leading the compiler to create your application. The make utility has many other advantages and can be used to a lot of purposes.
To get a complete overview, open a console and type:

<tt/man make/

or search for "GNU Make" in KDEHelp, "System GNU Info contents".
At least, you have an insight, why a developer needs the make utility for making it easier to compile his application.
Now, writing Makefiles is not only handwork until now, you also have to dig yourself into the whole syntax and options. But here
is the good news about KDevelop and any Make-utility: You just have to set the Make-Command in the <ref id="General Configuration"
name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog, and then you're done. All projects generated with KDevelop will use that Make command to build the
target application, and no typing at all. Just hit the buttons on the toolbar of KDevelop, beginning with the one after the second
separator line, or choose the desired function for Make in the "Build" menu.

The toolbar and the build-menu then offer the most-common functions that you need to let make do the dirty work:

<itemize>
<item> Compile File: is only active if you're working on a source file. It invokes make with the correct command to compile only
the current source.
<item> Make: just calls make and creates your target.
<item> Rebuild all: rebuilds the whole project
<item> Clean/Rebuild all: cleans the project directory first and then runs make again.
<item> Stop Build: cancels the current process- this is mostly used if you watch make working and staring at your sources. Then-
ahh- I forgot about this line...and you have to correct your code. Just hit Stop, correct the error you found by yourself and run
Make again.
</itemize>

But this is not the only way how KDevelop works together with make- for <idx/KDE/ applications, there are some things that are special,
like creating the message files for internationalization. These functions are also included, so no worry about these things
anymore.

Until now, you know about sources, the compiler and why make is needed. In the next section, we'll discuss how it comes that
projects created with KDevelop automatically can be compiled on most other Unix-platforms using the <tt/configure-/ script.

<sect1>Configure<label id="Configure">
<p>
The title of this section lets you probably question: Configure ? What has to be configured ? Or who ?
Well, assume you have written a program including a Makefile. Then you like to distribute it, but the binary compiled does only
run on your system or on systems that are compatible with yours. To support other platforms like different Unix-systems or
machines like Alpha's or RISC's, you have to recompile the program. The easiest way would be to copy the source package to the
target machine and run <tt/make/ again. But what if the target machine uses another compiler command or has in some other way a
problem to build your binary ? Not to mention more difficult issues like installation paths for your program and documentation-
e.g. <idx/KDE/ can be installed in <tt//opt/kde/ on one machine, while it is installed under <tt//usr/local/kde/ on another. In this
case, you would have to rewrite the Makefile each time to ensure a correct compilation and installation of your product.

Fortunately, GNU-tools have even more to provide than that mighty <tt/make/- the commonly used automake and autoconf
packages. It sounds good to hear something with "auto"- seems like something about application design can be done quick and easy,
which exactly hits the point.

Automake's purpose is generally to create a so-called <tt/Makefile.in/ from a file <tt/Makefile.am/ which you have to write for
your project. This Makefile.am consists of macros which can be interpreted and reduce the complexity that make offers, so a
Makefile.am is written safer and quicker than the final Makefile.

Having this said, who is finally creating me my Makefile ? Now, here comes autoconf. Autoconf requires several macro files
for the project. That are those Makefile.in's generated by automake and a file called <tt/configure.in/, also containing macros.
Hereby the Makefile.am and .in's are containing macros that are responsible for the way how to build the software in terms of
which sources have to be compiled, which files belong to the package and what name the final binary or library will have after a
build. Configure.in on the other hand contains macros for what the final configure-shell script will check for on the system
configure is executed. Those could be e.g. the compiler command, required libraries against which the final binary will be linked,
include-files the project needs and their location.

For example you want to write a <idx/KDE/ application. After writing your sources,
you want to distribute the program to the user community, and each user has to compile the binary on his own. Then you would write
a configure.in file that contains the macros for a <idx/KDE/-compliant application. That one macro finally expands to a check on the
system whether the Qt-library is installed, checks for the Qt-header files, the KDE-libraries and headers etc.

<bf>Summary:</bf>  To create a GNU-compliant application that is portable to different Unix-OS's and machines other than yours,
you will need to do the following:

<enum>
<item> write the sources of your project
<item> write a Makefile.am for each subdirectory, including the main project directory of your project
<item> write a configure.in file placed in the main project directory containing the macros for system requirements
<item> run automake
<item> run autoconf
</enum>

Then the main work is done. Automake creates the Makefile.in's, autoconf processes the configure.in and Makefile.in's and
generates an executable shell script called <tt/configure/. All you then have to do is to execute it with  <tt/./configure/ and
the script will run the checks of your choice. Finally Makefiles will be generated that allow a final execution of make (or gmake)
that will process all Makefiles and then you're done.

This seems to be a lot of stuff for writing a small application and much to learn especially how to write correct macros. But even
the fact that you provide a compilation on almost all Unix-systems will be worth this work sooner or later. Finally, you only have
to do this work once for your project and in case your project's files increase you only have to add the filenames to the macros.


Now, how far does KDevelop support this kind of application development and how complicated does it get for the programmer ?
The good news is, that you don't even have to know anything about macros and scripts. All details are hidden behind an easy to use
graphical interface doing the work for you. An application is therefore created with GNU tools in a very user-friendly way:

Just generate your application with KAppWizard, by the choice of your application's needs- may it be a pure C++ terminal
application or a kind of GUI program using <idx/Qt/ or the Qt/<idx/KDE/ libraries. All work is done automatically and your project
already contains the Makefiles that are created by an auto-execution of the GNU-tools and the configure-script.

This is it- you're ready to extend the source of your project, may it be by adding classes, dialogs, translations or
documentation, which is also completely automated. Just concentrate on the real work of the developer, which is providing
functionality for the final application that you want to create. In most cases, you probably won't come in touch with Makefiles at
all when using KDevelop.

<sect1>Debugging<label id="Debugging">
<p>
The following section covers a term that is widely used by developers: Debugging.  It means, that, although your compiler produces
the final application, your application may not run or crash during execution due to a so-called "bug" in the code. A program
error described by the name of this insect comes from the history of computing; one of the first errors that caused a machine to
crash was not obviously a malfunction- bugs were inside the computer which were responsible for it. Therefore, an error not
detectable on the first look is called a "bug", so "debugging" means to throw out bugs where they shouldn't be. Now, you don't
have to hunt them for real; assuming that today's computers are designed to keep them out by some kind of outer protection.
They have to be found inside the code, mostly ending the execution of a program with the message "Segmentation fault". GNU
provides another tool called <tt/gdb/, the GNU debugger. This terminal program allows to watch the internal values of an
application and the execution step by step with setting "breakpoints" in the code. Gdb stops the execution every time the program
comes to a breakpoint while executing. But like most other tools, the debugger is handled by another program providing a frontend
to it, allowing to easily watch values and the setting of breakpoints in the code.

For this purpose, your project's application is by default created with a compiler option for debugging, thereby storing
additional data in the executable to allow the localization of values and lines in the code. As a third-party frontend to gdb,
KDevelop makes use of KDbg, the KDebugger. To debug your program, you just have to select "Debug" in the Build-menu or press the
according toolbar button displayed by a wheel having glasses over it, signaling that you want to watch the execution.

KDevelop then opens the Tools-window and starts your application with KDbg. The KDbg interface appears inside the Tools-window and
allows the usage just like you started it from outside.

In general, the above steps are clearly showing the need of certain steps that a developer has to do when starting to write his
own application, and cover issues that are common to all projects. Also, we explained what part KDevelop does for a developer and
how it supports the idea of providing an easy way to Unix programming. To get further information about the role and purpose of
GNU tools, you should read the documentation provided with them, commonly accessed via the <tt/man/ command or by the "System GNU
Info contents" section in KDEHelp.

<sect>Development with KDevelop<label id="Development with KDevelop">
<p>
In this chapter you will get a general overview how you can use KDevelop and the internal Dialog Editor to create own applications.
Thereby, all tools are described by their use during the development process. If you are a beginner in C++/GUI design and
programming, you should read <em/"The KDevelop Programming Handbook"/, which describes some basics for program design and shows a
more detailed use of KDevelop by sample projects which you can follow step-by-step to get used with the way applications are
created using KDevelop. Also you should have read chapter <ref id="Programs" name="Programs"> to gain a general understanding
why Unix applications should make use of provided development tools; this will make things easier when you hit references to what
Makefiles are etc.

<sect1>What are KDevelop Project Applications ?
<p>
Projects created with KDevelop make it very easy for developers to use the GNU standard development tools. In opposition to the
self-creation of Makefiles, which have to be written anyway because of the project's complexity, those provide not only a better
way of Makefile generation but also a good and safe way to provide a fast adaption towards different systems by autoconf-generated
<tt/configure/ scripts.

The distribution of your applications does not require the end-user to have anything different installed than a C++ compiler and
the development libraries, which is most often the case; but you can as well distribute binary packages of your application. In
either way, the end-user of your product does not have to have KDevelop installed. For giving away your sources, we advise to
include the project file of KDevelop as well, as this makes it very easy for other developers to work with your sources if they
use KDevelop as well. For projects where several developers, maybe working on different places, are involved, this should the case
anyway to ensure consistency of the Makefiles so you don't run into trouble. Especially on multi language applications, translators
won't actually work with the source code, except in cases that require corrections for enabling translation support. Anyway, those
will be thankful as KDevelop simplifies their work to a minimum by adding their language and reducing the work to concentrate on
the translation.

With using KDevelop for your own projects, you would start creating a new application with the KAppWizard. There, you can also
set the project type according the goals of your program. Then, you would start developing the user interface by adding
widgets that are already constructed in the libraries and only have to be called by your application, or by self-constructions
that can be made with the dialogeditor. Next comes the extension of the user interface by changing and extending those parts that
are already made by KDevelop like the statusbar, menubar and toolbars. As resources are collected in a resource file, this can be
extended simply by adding new values to the already existing one; the given resources can also be used as a guideline for adding
your specific ones. After implementing the functionality to methods that are either generated empty by the dialogeditor or already
containing code for standard user actions, you should extend the User Manual by simply editing the provided sgml index file
towards describing your applications capabilities. The last step would be to generate translation files and to distribute your
project to translators doing the rest to enhance internationalization.

But even for non-GUI application designers the IDE offers an easy way to create new projects; the editor and Class Browser in
conjunction with KDevelop's powerful project management will reduce the time for development to the minimum that is required for
implementation of functionality.

<sect1>Short Description of KDevelop's Tools
<p>
With KDevelop you have chosen a package, that, in conjuction with the use of other tools, will provide you a prefect and flexible
environment for object-orientated application development under Unix-Systems. Generally, KDevelop consists of the programming
environment and the dialogeditor; besides that all needed programs that can be helpful for designing applications are embedded in
one or the other way.

<sect2>Programming Environment and Dialog Editor
<p>

<sect3>The Programming Environment
<p>
The Programming Environment is the user interface that KDevelop provides for creating and maintaining projects, implicitly using
many other tools by simplifying their use. It's build-in Editor and Helpbrowser as well as the Class Browser reduce the amount of
work that development processes usually burden on the programmer. The ease of use make writing applications for Unix an enjoyment
on it's own and will probably result in shorter release cycles and better development improvements. From here, you're managing
your project throughout all its details, keep the overview over your classes and don't have to use additional consoles for your
work, as well as the integration of all user interfaces results in the fact that you only have to work with one window under X and
don't have to watch for several ones spread all over your desktop.

<sect3>The Dialog Editor
<p>
KDevelop's build-in dialogeditor offers a simple way of designing user interfaces with the <idx/Qt/ and <idx/KDE/ libraries. It's
simple way to do almost everything with the mouse allows a rapid construction of dialogs and main views for applications and their
direct transformation into C++ code, which is directly added to the project. As the dialogeditor is embedded into the rest of
KDevelop's user interface, you have the same commands available than working in Programming mode. This allows e.g. construction of a
dialog, generation of the code output and it's direct testing within the program by the availability of the make-commands and you still
can control the compiler output without having to switch back to the programming view. For a detailed description, see <ref
id="The Dialog Editor">.

<sect2>KAppWizard and the Classtools
<p>
The KAppWizard and the Classtools provided for project generation and automatic code extension are intended to make the
creation of applications as easy and safe as possible and offers a good way for beginners in <idx/Qt//<idx/KDE/ programming to start
actually working themselves into the details of GUI application design, as results can be achieved very quickly.

<sect3>KAppWizard
<p>
KAppWizard is intended to create full-functional application projects that are ready-to-run by using GNU-standard tools and, for
GUI-programs, taking advantage of the <idx/KDE/ and <idx/Qt/ libraries. By specifying only the information that is required as a
minimum, users are enabled to start working at a new project within seconds. Calling KAppWizard should be the first step to be done for
creating a new application with KDevelop.

KAppWizard provides you a so-called application skeleton with all needed C++ source code files for a running application. After
you specified a projectname and set the needed preferences, your new project will be generated and you have a completele application
that already contains a lot of functionality (for KDE and Qt projects), without even having to type one line of C++ code yourself. When
specifying the complete set of options the program generator offers, your application already contains:
<itemize>
<item>an SDI-Interface (for working with one document per application window), based on the document-view-controller model
<item>Menus and dialogs for opening and saving files as well as printing dialogs
<item>a toolbar and statusbar already providing complete functionality
<item>a helpsystem, containing an sgml-based user manual and statusbar help
<item>a complete HTML-based API (application programming interface) documentation for the current state of the project
<item>an installation routine though make
</itemize>

The KAppWizard is available by the Project-menu, entry "New...".

<sect3>Classtools
<p>
The term "Classtools" describes a variety of functions that are available for the developer to work on a project not only by
an object-orientated language but using the sources in an object-orientated way. Working with classes instead of having to
watch for files offers a very flexible way to extend a project and lets the user concentrate on the objects the project contains.
The tools that KDevelop offers are a Classgenerator and a Class Browser, where each one provides a lot of automated
functionality.

<sect4> Creating a new class with the Classgenerator
<p>
After generating a project with the KAppWizard your work as a developer would be to add a set of classes that match the design of
the application. The typical process without using KDevelop would be to create a new header and sourcefile, add them manually to
the according Makefile.am and to start writing the classes declaration and implementation. To simplify the whole process, the
Classgenerator lets you do this by only specifying the new class by its name, inherited class, inheritance attribute and further
information such as class documentation by it's purpose for the project. Additionally, you can also change the filenames that are
preset by the generator and if the class would be Qt-signal/slot enabled by default.

The rest of the work is done automatically- you don't have to take care for Makefile.am, files and the class itself. A new "make"
invocation is enough to include the new class in the compilation process. As the Class Browser updates itself after the addition of
a class, the declaration and implementation is available at once and you can start working on the extension of the class. The
Classgenerator is invoked by the Project-menu, entry "New Class".

<sect4>The Class Browser
<p>
The Class Browser displays all types of objects and fuctions of your project in a tree left of the editing windows. A classparser
scans all files for methods and classes and makes them available by graphical symbols. Over those, context-menus offer a
specialized functionality to work with the sources by focusing on the classes and functions.

Selecting a class will result in opening the file that contains the declaration; on methods and functions this will
show you the implementation. For a full description, see <ref id="The Class Browser" name="The Class Browser">

<sect1> The Development Process
<p>
The development of a new application with KDevelop can generally be divided into two major steps: first, you have to generate a
program skeleton with KAppWizard, then the "rest" of the development has to be done using KDevelop's features, which only
requires your abilities as a programmer. To describe the development process, we assume you want to create a Qt/<idx/KDE/ application,
which implies using most of KDevelop's features for working with these types of project, so you have a general "HOW-TO".

<sect2>Creating a Program Skeleton
<p>
To start creating your application, you normally would call the KAppWizard, enter the project name and generate the program. By
this, the wizard automatically creates a project file for the application and inserts the KDevelop areas into the Makefile.am's
which will be used later when extending the application. The project file is the file you have to load for opening the project in
later sessions.

You call KAppWizard by the "Project"-menu, entry "New...". When the wizard appears, you have to specify the project
type on the first page. Selecting "Next >>" brings you to the next page where you have to insert the project name, version,
directory and your personal information. Page 3 offers more detailed options, page 4 and 5 allow editing file headers for header
and implementation files that are inserted automatically according to your selection. If you already have file headers you want to
use, you can choose those files as well. The last page contains an output window and an error message window. When selecting
"Create", your application will be generated and the actions that are executed can be seen in the output window. If READY appears
in the output window, the KAppWizard is finished and you can select "Exit" to return to the Programming Environment. To build the
binary, choose "Make" from the Build-menu or choose the according button in the toolbar. You can as well test the functions already
present by choosing "Execute" from the Build-menu.

<sect2>Developing an Application
<p>
This section describes the development phase of applications with KDevelop and the Dialog Editor- and all work can be done within
the IDE.

The development steps are generally to edit the source files, the compilation of the project sources followed by the linker
process binding all object files to the final binary. Then errors have to be located which either prevented a compilation or
linking or are semantical bugs that can be found by a debugging session. Finally, the documentation has to be extended and
translations have to be added. But as all those steps can mix which each other, it is not that easy to describe a general way how
to develop your own application. Typically, the usual procedure would be to first create all visible parts of the project like the
main view and the dialogs for configuring any options, then generate the source code and implement all needed connections that
still have to be done like changing the menubar and toolbars, adding statusbar help for new menu entries and fill the new member
functions with objects that are displaying your dialogs. Then you would compile your application and test it's capabilities, fix
errors and test it again. The following sections describe how this would be done; for your particular application
you may choose another way- KDevelop leaves you enough flexibility to decide what to do at what time.

<sect3>User Interfaces
<p>
The User Interface of an application is actually what the user sees and by which he interacts with the program. Therefore a
program generally has a menubar, toolbars and a statusbar as well as a main view which would be e.g. a text input window for an
editor. KAppWizard generated applications already contain a complex functionality on graphical interfaces- the frame structure
takes care of standard elements such as bars and buttons. When developing your application, you have to extend the given structure
to give the program the user interaction capability you want to provide. One part of the work is the design of dialogs e.g. for
changing values like the brush width in a paint application. This can be done easily with the Dialog Editor inside KDevelop. Now,
how do you create those good-looking dialogs ? As the Qt library is a GUI toolkit, it provides a base set of so-called "widgets"
like labels displaying plain text, lineedits for text input and buttons for navigation and selection commands. Besides these
"low-level" parts of user interfaces, standard dialogs are provided and are ready to use such as printing dialogs. The
<idx/KDE-libraries/ then are based on the Qt-library and contain replacements for certain dialogs as well as additional widgets that
can be used in your application. So, when you start designing your applications behavior towards the user, you should make yourself
comfortable with the widgets provided with <idx/Qt/ and <idx/KDE/. The online-documentation of Qt offers screenshots for most of them,
so you should have a look there first. Then we advise to have a closer look at the KDE-UI library, offering other widgets. Libraries
like the KHTML library contains very specialized widgets that a lot of programs make use of. It just simplifies application design like
the predefined dialogs provided with Qt. For your own dialogs, those low-level widgets are the one you need. A dialog merely
consists by a collection of different widgets combined together building the interface and is technically programmed by C++ code
in a class that is derived from QWidget or a more specialized dialog class that inherits QWidget. The program using the widget
therefore needs an object of the widget's class- this is almost all you have to understand how dialogs or views are used.

The Dialog Editor of KDevelop now offers a nice way to simply construct dialogs and user interfaces visually instead of you having
to combine dialogs with pure C++ code together- this is the hard way to create interfaces. Switch to the Dialog Editor by
choosing the according entry in the "Tools"-menu (or by the toolbar button). You will see that KDevelop's face has changed but for
e.g. the menubar and the toolbar are very similar. This makes it very easy to switch back and forth between the two working modes
and you will feel comfortable in both after some time. There you can construct your views and dialogs as you like and set all
available preferences for the items the view will contain. When you're finished, select "Generate Sources" from the Build-menu;
the Dialog Editor and the project management will take care of the rest. You can test if everything went OK by selecting Make or
Execute, this will build your application including your new sources. But don't expect that dialogs are already usable- this is a
matter of implementation that is the usual way a developer works. Don't worry- this isn't too difficult, too. For more information
about creating dialogs, see <ref id="The Dialog Editor" name="The Dialog Editor">, examples and guidelines can also be found in
<em/The KDevelop Programming Handbook/.

<sect3>Binding New Elements
<p>
After you have created your user interfaces and generated the sources, you are ready to make your application use them by objects.
As described above, a usual GUI-based program contains bars and the main view; additionally the main view operates with the bars,
which are part of the main application class, and the document object which it is connected to. In terms of object-oriented
design, you would describe the given architecture as the "Document-View-Controller"-model. This model describes the basic
functions for objects in an application towards their role within the program. The Controller represents the one coordinating the
main application and provides user interaction through a menubar and additionally toolbars and a statusbar. The Document class
takes the task of representing a document the user works with. Therefore, a document class should do all actions like loading
files and saving them again. The view now is in the center of the application window, showing the user a part of the document
visually and provides all functions to manipulate the data by the user. As the bars and toolbars are already present, your work
would be to create the main view and additional dialogs by which the user can change any settings or has access to additional
functions.

To build your main-view, the generated source code for your application already contains a class in the form of
&lt;YourApplication&gt;View which inherits the QWidget class (this is the minimal class that handles visual interfaces in Qt and
therefore in <idx/KDE/ as well). In general, there are three different ways how to extend the given class:
<itemize>
<item>remove the document-view structure and use one of the predefined "big" widgets already containing a lot of functionality-
just remove the View-class and replace the view-object by another.
<item>change the inheritance of the View-class. Change the inheritance to e.g. QMultiLineEdit and your application would be an
editor.
<item>if your main view will consist of several separated parts, create the widgets and their classes you need with the
dialogeditor and create objects of these classes in the view-class constructors that in combination will build the main view.
</itemize>

For dialogs, things are a bit different. The usual way would be to call a dialog through a menubar entry and additionally by a
toolbar icon. After you constructed your dialog and generated the sources, the class is available for creating an object that will
be the dialog. So you first have to look for a suitable place in the menubar to add an entry which will open the dialog when
selected by the user. If the already given menus do not match your needs, create a new popup menu just like the others and insert
your entry and the slot you want to call when the menuitem gets selected. Then implement the slot by creating an instance of the
dialog class and call the dialog with the member functions given by the base class. Also you have to specify an ID for the
menuentry. The frame applications have all IDs already given collected in a file resource.h, so you only have to add the ID and
give it a new number. Then you're done- additionally you could construct another toolbar icon and add the statushelp message. Your
application now offers a new functionality which is visible to the user. Now you have to add the implementation of methods that
your dialog will be operating with to manipulate any values. Finally, call your make-tool or "Execute" and the changed files will
be recompiled; the result of your changes can then be tested immediately.

<sect3>The Complete Development Process
<p>
Above, we discussed the usual way how to start working on a new application using KDevelop and how to extend the user interface.
Now, these are the standard steps where the IDE helps you, but KDevelop does more than providing tools for creating applications
and their visual parts. The following gives a short description of the main functionality that is offered for enhancing
application development.

<sect4>Sourcecode Management
<p>
The KDevelop IDE provides a lot of methods to the programmer to achieve his goals within the shortest time.  As described above,
the KAppWizard and the Dialog Editor shorten the time you would usually need to get to the same result manually. But this
didn't cover the work a programmer has to do usually: working on the implementation of his application to provide a proper
execution by the end-user. Now, why is KDevelop the IDE you would want to use as a coding environment, including it's use to
create even non-GUI applications ?

Implicitely, the IDE keeps track of your project in general; that means, you don't have to take care for saving changes, the
Makefile generation and so on- this is providing full project-management, and KDevelop plays out all it's power here in any case
of C++ application development. It is easy to understand that, after taking away the management from the programmer, he is more
concentrated on working out the sourcecode. On the other hand, the code is usually spread over many different files across
the project, so you can separate certain parts. But this means still working the hard way- being the developer, you still
would have to struggle with creating these files and writing standard contents like file headers containing the date and the
author's name as well as e.g. license terms for the code. Additionally, this requires that you have to remember where your
functions, class declarations and implementations are in the project. Therefore, KDevelop contains the Classtools- a variety of
actions, that allow fast work and moving the developer's focus from files to objects- classes, structures and methods. The
classgenerator lets you create a new class including inheritance, attributes and documentation easily . For object-oriented work,
the Class Browser brings you to the location of your objects; it doesn't matter any more where the code is actually. The
Browser scans all sources automatically and rebuilds itself after additions to keep up with your work and enables you to access
the new code directly. By context-menus, the browser offers even more fuctionality, like bringing you to the implementation or to
the declaration of member functions. Then, the addition of members are done graphically by dialogs- no search for the file and the
place you would have to add your entries. Finally, you can get an even more specialized view of your project's classes by the
Classtool dialog, providing you trees that show the usage, contents and inheritance of classes and their objects. For more
detailed information, see <ref id="The Class Browser" name="The Class Browser">.

<sect4>Building and Executing your Application
<p>
The KDevelop IDE is specially designed to take away all those steps that you have to do periodically like building and executing
your program as well as locating errors in the sourcecode.

You're starting the build-process by:
<itemize>
<item>clicking on the symbols "Build" or "Rebuild All" in the toolbar
<item>or selecting "Build"/"Rebuild All" from the Build-menu.
</itemize>

To execute your application, choose
<itemize>
<item>the symbol "Execute" or "Debug" (starting KDbg with your program) from the toolbar
<item>by the according menuentries in the Build-menu.
<item>or by "Execute with Arguments" to start your application with additional arguments
</itemize>
For more information about the build-process, see <ref id="Projects" name="Projects">.

<sect4>Searching Program Errors
<p>
As naturally errors occur either during the build-process (which are detected by the compiler and are called syntactical errors
because they result from a wrong syntax of the sources) or during the execution of the application, those have to be found and
removed by the programmer. For locating errors, the developer needs the information what exactly caused its occurance. As
mentioned, the compiler is able to detect syntax errors himself, resulting in that the executable can't be build (this can also
happen by the linker when he detects "unresolved symbols"-see <ref id="Linker Options" name="Linker Options">). As he gives out a
description of the error as detailed as possible, the error can be found and removed. During the build-process, you will see the output
window pop up showing you what your make-tool and the compiler has to say. In case of errors or warnings, just press the mouse button
over the error line and the editor will open the affected file and sets the cursor to the errorline. This can also be done by the
entries in the "View"-menu, "Next Error" and "Previous Error" or by the according keyboard shortcuts. You will find that this is very
functional and saves a lot of time to get to the error, thus for removing the cause your knowledge as a programmer is asked.

Runtime Errors, which occur during execution and will mostly result in a segmentation fault, are sometimes hard to find.
Therefore, you can enable the compiler to add information within the binary to watch the execution by the sourcecode. A debugger
then is another program that lets you do this by starting the application and letting you set breakpoints in the code where the
execution stops, so you can control critical implementations and by this detect at least the line that caused the error. Finding
the real cause is another task; it depends on the programmer to locate this. The <bf/gdb/ is a debugger that is provided with the
GNU compiler and programs like <em/ddd/ or <em/KDbg/ are frontends that allow an easier use. KDevelop therefore uses KDbg and lets
you invoke the debugging process by the commands "Debug" in the Build-menu or by the "Debug" symbol in the toolbar. For more
information about debugging applications, see <ref id="Projects" name="Projects"> and <em/The KDevelop Programming Handbook/.

</itemize>

<sect>Overview<label id="Overview">
<p>
Looking at KDevelop, the user interface can be described by it's logical separation: the main window, the treeview and the output
window, surrounded by the menubar, toolbars and the statusbar. This section describes the purpose of each part of the interface,
starting by the windows, followed by the bars and the functions they provide.

<sect1>Main Window
<p>
The main window consists of four tabulators for which the left two are for editing purpose. First comes the Header-/Resource
window for headers and any other text files like the documentation sgml's, then the C/C++ window for sourcecodes. These are
followed by the Documentation window displaying in HTML-format. At last is the Tools window for external programs like KIconedit
and KDbg which are embedded into the IDE. Any Tool that is registered can be accessed via the Tools-menu; whereas the registration
of third-party programs can easily be done by a configuration dialog (see <ref id="General Configuration" name="General
Configuration">). For a description of the Editor windows functionality, see chapter <ref id="Working with the Editor" name="Working
with the Editor">, and for the Helpbrowser, you should look at section <ref id="Using the Documentation Browser" name="Using the
Documentation Browser">.
<sect1> The Class Browser and Fileviewers
<p>

<sect2>The Class Viewer
<p>
The Class Viewer (CV) shows the classes of your project as well as global functions and variables.  Opening the tree will show all
member functions and members with symbols for attributes (private, protected and public, signals and slots), so you can see the
properties of members visually without switching to the header file.  Selecting the class name will open the according
headerfile containing the class and set the cursor to the class declaration beginning. Selecting member functions will open the
implementation file and place the cursor at the function header.	For elements, KDevelop will look for the header file and place
the cursor at the line the element is declarated.	The classviewer also provides popup-menus that offer more specified options,
see <ref id="The Class Browser" name="The Class Browser"> for more detailed information.

<sect2>The Logical File Viewer
<p>
The Logical File Viewer (LFV) allows sorting files by filters in groups. Individual groups can be added by the properties
entry of the project menu or by a right click on the tree items. This allows a more specialized search for files that you want to
access quickly, in the first place only showing project-included files. According to their Mime-type, the files will be opened
when selected. You will like the LFV for things like selecting pixmaps- this will start KIconEdit (if installed on the system) in
the Tools-window and opens the chosen picture.

<sect2>The Real File Viewer
<p>
The Real File Viewer (RFV) shows the project directory tree with all files, so you can edit non-project files or files hidden by
the LFV like configure.in and Makefiles.
Popup-menus also provide functions like adding or removing files to the current project.

<sect2>The Documentation Tree
<p>
The Documentation Tree (DOC) displays all available HTML-based documentation that is configured as books. Selecting a book will
open the first page in the Browser window. Also, a popup-menu provides personal configuration for additional HTML-based
documentation packages.

<sect1>Output window
<p>
The Output window is separated as well into a messages window, a stdin/stdout
window and a stderr window for the following necessities:
<itemize>
<item> messages window:	displays all output of the compiler. Clicking on error messages will change the edit widget to set the
cursor to the line the compiler found an error.
<item> stdout window: display for terminal based applications that send messages to the standard output of the computer. Note that
Terminal applications are now started in an external console window.
<item> stderr window: displays all the error messages your program
produces. This is useful for testing purposes. The Output window is programmed to show up each time an external process is called,
such as make or a terminal application.
</itemize>

<sect1>Menubar Commands
<p>

<sect2>File Management and Printing
<p>
This section covers the functions that KDevelop provides about files; accessed via the File-menu in the menubar or by the
according icons in the toolbar:

<itemize>
<item><bf/New			Ctrl+N/ Opens the "New File" dialog, allowing to create a new file. The file can be created using different templates
and the filename has to be given as well as the path where the file will be created.<p>
<item><bf/Open			Ctrl+O/ displays the "Open File..." dialog and lets you choose a file to be opened.<p>
<item><bf/Close		Ctrl+W/ Closes the file in the top editing window<p>
<item><bf/Save			Ctrl+S/	Saves the file opened in the top editing window. If the file has not been saved yet, the "Save File As..."
dialog will be opened to let you choose a path and filename for the file to be saved.<p>
<item><bf/Save As.../ Opens the "Save File As..." dialog to let you save the current file under a new filename<p>
<item><bf/Save All/ Saves all changed files<p>
<item><bf/Print...	Ctrl+P/ Opens the "Print File" dialog where you can set various options for printing either using a2ps, enscript or
lpr<p>
<item><bf/Quit			Ctrl+Q/ Exits KDevelop. If files are changed, you will be asked if you want to save these files.<p>
</itemize>
<p>

<sect2>Editing Files
<p>
Here, the "Edit" menu and the according icons in the toolbar are covered which provide editing files. Also the editing functions
are available via a context-menu in the editor.
<itemize>
<item><bf/Undo			Ctrl+Z/ Reverts the last editing operation<p>
<item><bf/Redo	Ctrl+Z/ lets you do the last undo step again<p>
<item><bf/Cut			Ctrl+X/ cuts out a selection and copies it to the system clipboard.<p>
<item><bf/Copy			Ctrl+C/ copies a selection to the system clipboard. This also counts for selections made in the documentation
browser.<p>
<item><bf/Paste		Ctrl+V/ inserts the clipboard contents at the current cursor position.<p>
<item><bf/Indent		Ctrl+I/ Indent moves a selection to the right<p>
<item><bf/UnIndent	Ctrl+U/ UnIndent moves a selection to the left<p>
<item><bf/Insert File.../ Lets you select a file and inserts its contents at the current cursor position<p>
<item><bf/Search...		Ctrl+F/Opens the Search dialog that looks for an expression in the current file. For a search across several
files, "Search in files..." should be used.<p>
<item><bf/Repeat Search	F3/ Repeats the last search for an expression. This also counts for searches that were made across the
documentation, where more than one hit was found in the same page. The next hit will be displayed by choosing "Repeat Search"
or F3 and signed as marked.<p>
<item><bf/Replace...		Ctrl+R/ Opens the "Search and Replace" dialog that allows the search for an expression and replaces the found
text with a new expression.<p>

<item><bf/Search in files...		Ctrl+Alt+F/Displays the "Search in files..." dialog, that handles <tt/grep/ on whole directories with
wildcards. Search results are displayed with a list of the filenames, line and expression. Choosing an entry will open the file
and the cursor is set to the line of the search result<p>
<item><bf/Select All/ Selects the whole text of the file currently opened in the top editing window<p>
<item><bf/Deselect All/ Deselects the whole text of the current file. This is often used for multiple selections so you don't have
to deselect each one separately<p>
<item><bf/Invert Selection/ Inverts the selection, meaning that a selection becomes deselected and text which is not selected
becomes selected.<p>
</itemize>
<p>

<sect2>View Configuration
<p>
The View-Menu covers closing and opening functions for windows and commands to enable/disable the tool- and statusbar as well as
to jump errors in the code.
<itemize>
<item><bf/Line...	Ctrl+L/Opens a "Go to Line..." dialog that lets you insert a linenumber to show in the actual file. The last
linenumber is remembered and marked, so you can either jump to that line again or just enter a new linenumber you want to see.<p>
<item><bf/Next Error		F4/Jumps to the next error KDevelop detects from the output. The output message of Make or other tools should
give you a descriptive help what the problem is, so you can correct the error.<p>
<item><bf/Previous Error		Shift+F4/ Jumps to the previous error that was reported.<p>
<item><bf/Tree-View	Ctrl+T/en/disables the Tree window on the left side of the main view containing the Class Browser, LFV, RFV and
DOC-tree.<p>

<item><bf/Toolbar/en/disables the toolbar.<p>
<item><bf/Browser-Toolbar/en/disables the browser toolbar, containing the back, forward and search buttons for the browser<p>
<item><bf/Statusbar	Ctrl+B/en/disables the statusbar.<p>
<item><bf/Refresh/ rescans all files to rebuild the Class Browser. The scanning progress is shown in the statusbar progress display.<p>
</itemize>
<p>

<sect2>Creating and Maintaining Projects
<p>
This section describes functions that are available in the "Project"-menu and are supposed to cover the creation and maintaining
of projects
<itemize>
<item><bf/New.../ Starts the KAppWizard and allows you to create a new project by choosing application type, name,
version and other options.<p>
<item><bf/Open/ Shows the Open Project dialog, where you can choose a KDevelop project file to be opened. After selection, the
project will be loaded.<p>
<item><bf/Close/Closes the current project. This is mostly done automatically when you quit KDevelop, invoke the KAppWizard or open
another project.<p>
<item><bf/New Class.../Starts the class generator to create a new class that will be added to the current project. The class
generator lets you specify classname, inheritance and filenames for the new class.<p>
<item><bf/Add existing File(s)/ Opens a selection dialog where you can choose the files that you want to add to the current project and
the path where they will be copied to. If you choose a destination that was currently not included in the project, e.g. creating a new
subdirectory, KDevelop will copy the files to add to the new subdirectory and create a new Makefile.am. After the copy process,
your project will be rebuild by automake and autoconf to include the new subdirectory into the make-process.<p>
<item><bf/Add new translation file/ Opens a language selection dialog that lets you choose the translation file language that will be
added to the project. This is mostly used by translators who can easily add their language to the project and work on the
translation without having to care about the Makefile.am's<p>
<item><bf/File Properties/ Opens the File Properties dialog showing a copy of the LFV and the project file options. Here, the
properties for your files have to be set like installation path and file type.<p>
<item><bf/Make messages and merge/ This is intended to create the messages file for your project. The message file is the one
containing all strings that are set up in the sources for internationalization and is used by translators to create the .po file
for their target language.<p>
<item><bf/Make API-Doc/ Calls KDoc on your header files and generates a HTML output with the documentation of your project
classes.<p>
<item><bf/Make User-Manual/ runs ksgml2html on your manual sgml file, creating a HTML user manual. If ksgml2html is not installed,
sgml2html will be used to do this.<p>
<item><bf/Make Distribution:/<p>
<itemize>
<item><bf/tar.gz / creates a distribution file of your current project in the project directory that is ready to ship to the end-users
containing the sources of your project. The end-user has to <tt/tar zxvf yourproject.tar.gz / to unpack it to a source directory and
use the standard commands <tt>./configure, make </tt>and <tt/make install/.<p>
</itemize>
<item><bf/Options/ Opens the Project Options dialog that
lets you change various settings for your project. This could be a new version number or the compiler options to set to -02 for a
release with optimization.<p>
</itemize>
<p>

<sect2>Building Projects
<p>
This section describes the Build menu that covers all actions to be done with make or actions like rebuilding the project's online
help or API documentation.

<itemize>
<item><bf/Compile file.../Active, if the top editing window is the C++ Window. This only compiles the current implementation file
and lets you save time in case you suspect errors.<p>
<item><bf/Make/ Invokes the make-command to your project and builds the target.<p>
<item><bf/Rebuild All/ Rebuilds all object files and the target of you project.<p>
<item><bf/Clean Rebuild All/ Cleans the project directory from all make-created files and rebuilds the target.<p>
<item><bf/Stop Build/ Stops the current process.<p>
<item><bf/Execute/ Executes your target after building the program with make.<p>
<item><bf/Execute with Arguments/ Executes your target with arguments. First, a dialog appears to let you specify the execution
arguments (which are saved in the project for the next session), then your application uses the entered commandline. Mind that your
application program is started from the project directory directly<p>
<item><bf/Debug.../ Opens KDbg in the Tools-Window to debug your
application. In this case, KDbg automatically opens the file containing the main() function and executes your application.<p>
<item><bf/Distclean/ Removes all files that are generated by the project like object files etc. Distclean has to be done before
distributing your project, so the distribution file doesn't contain any platform-specific files like those that were generated by your
compiler.<p>
<item><bf/Autoconf and automake/ Calls Make on the file Makefile.dist, located in your main project directory. Makefile.dist contains
all commands for automake, autoconf etc. to build your project. If you added files manually or changed macros yourself, you should run
Autoconf afterwards, followed by Configure to recreate all Makefiles.<p>
<item><bf/Configure/ Executes the configure-script generated by autoconf. If this command cannot be executed, run Autoconf and then
Configure again.<p>
</itemize>
<p>

<sect2>Calling Tools
<p>
The Tools-menu contains by default the entries for the internal Dialog Editor (which can also be started by the toolbar button) and
the following programs if installed: KDbg, KIconEdit and KTranslator. These are checked by the KDevelop installation program and
inserted in the given order into the menu. Invoking a tool will open the "Tools"-window and start the selected program inside this
window. The Tools menu can be edited by the Tools-entry in the Options-menu; see <ref id="Configuring the &dquot;Tools&dquot; Menu"
name="Configuring the &dquot;Tools&dquot; Menu">).
<sect2>Changing KDevelop's settings
<p>
The Options-menu contains all entries for invoking configuration dialogs with which you can change KDevelop's default settings.
Major settings like those for the editor or printing have their own entries; general settings of KDevelop's behavoir can be made
with the <ref id="KDevelop Setup" name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog.
<itemize>
<item><bf/Editor.../ Allows the configuration of the editor's behavoir like word-breaking, selections etc.<p>
<item><bf/Editor Colors.../ Here, you can set the color-configuration of the editor like e.g. the background.<p>
<item><bf/Editor Defaults.../ This sets the default display like font and fontsize for the editor<p>
<item><bf/Syntax-Highlighting / This dialog lets you configure the fonts and colors for the highlighting of several programming
languages, including HTML, and the mime-types highlighting will be enabled to.<p>
<item><bf/Documentation Browser/ In this tab-dialog, you can set the fonts, sizes and colors for the internal Helpbrowser<p>
<item><bf/Configure Printer.../ Contains the entries for the printer configuration dialogs according to the used printing program, a2ps
or enscript.<p>
<itemize>
<item><bf/a2ps/ Configures the printer for use with a2ps. See Printing for more information.<p>
<item><bf/enscript/ Configures the printer for use with enscript. See Printing for more information.<p>
</itemize>
<item><bf/Tools.../ Opens the Configure Tools dialog. Here, you can configure the "Tools" menu by adding or removing programs that will
be started in the Tools-window.<p>
<item><bf/KDevelop Setup/ Opens the KDevelop Setup dialog. The first tabulator configures general settings, followed by the
key-configuration and the Documentation settings. The Documentation settings also include the generation of a new set of
HTML-library documentation and the rebuilding of the search index for the Helpbrowser.
</itemize>

<sect2>The Window Menu
<p>
The Window menu contains a list with all currently open files. This allows a quick swith to another file you're currently working
on.

<sect2>Managing Bookmarks
<p>
The Bookmarks menu is intended for adding and removing bookmarks you want to set in the current editing file. As KDevelop uses two
editing windows, each one configures it's bookmarks seperately.
<itemize>
<item><bf/Set Bookmark/ Opens a context-menu with up to nine configurable bookmarks. This allows setting a bookmark to a certain entry
in the bookmarks menu by logical reasons.<p>
<item><bf/Add Bookmark/ Adds the line of the current cursor position to the bookmarks menu as a bookmark. Mind that this could
overwrite a bookmark set with the Set Bookmark-option.<p>
<item><bf/Clear Bookmarks / Clears the bookmark-entries for the top editing window, e.g. if the Header-Window is visible and you call
Clear Bookmarks, the entries for the Header-Window are deleted.<p>
<item><bf/Header-Window/ Contains the bookmark-list for the Header-Window. Selecting a bookmark will set the cursor to the selected
bookmarks' line. Mind that bookmarks are only assigned to the file they are set to, so if you change to another file, the
bookmarks are not deleted but choosing a bookmark won't change to the file they are assingned to as well.<p>
<item><bf>C/C++-Window</bf> Contains the bookmark-list for the C/C++-Window. The preferences are the same as for the
Header-Window.
</itemize>

<sect2>Online Help
<p>
The Help-menu contains entries for navigating in the Helpbrowser as well as entries for library and online-documentation for the
most recently used cases. Accessing additional online-documentation can be achieved with the DOC-tree in the treeview
automatically opened (if Autoswitch is enabled) when changing to the Documentation Browser window.
<itemize>
<item><bf/Back / Opens the page opened before the actual one.<p>
<item><bf/Forward / Opens the next page of the browser-history, available after a "Back"-action.<p>
<item><bf/Search Marked Text		F2/ Scans the search-index for text currently marked in the editing windows or the browser-window. Afte
the search, a result page is shown which lets you select the help-page to switch to. After choosing a page, the browser will
highlight the found entry for the expression the search was invoked for. With the F3 key the next search result on the same page
will be displayed if more than one hit was reported for the search on one page.<p>
<item><bf/Search for Help on.../Opens the Search for Help on... dialog that lets you search for a specific expression you want help on.<p>
<item><bf/Contents		F1/ Opens the User's Manual to KDevelop index page so you have access to this manual.<p>
<item><bf/KDevelop Homepage/ Opens the KDevelop Homepage in the browser window if Internet access is provided.<p>
<item><bf/Bug Report.../ Opens the KDevelop Bug Report dialog, where you can send a bug-report directly to the KDevelop Team by email.
See <ref id="Bug Reporting" name="Bug Reporting"><p>
<item><bf>C/C++ Reference</bf> Displays the language reference index page. If the
reference is not installed, an error page shows you how to get the reference and how to install it correctly.<p>
<item><bf/Qt-Library/ Changes to the index page of the Qt-library documentation provided with your copy of the Qt-library.<p>
<item><bf/KDE-Core-Library/ Opens the class-index file of the KDE-Core library documentation.<p>
<item><bf/KDE-GUI-Library/  As above for the GUI-library<p>
<item><bf/KDE-KFile-Library/ As above for the KFile-library<p>
<item><bf/KDE-HTML-Library/ As above for the HTML-library<p>
<item><bf/Project-API-Doc/ Changes to the project's class-documentation index file.<p>
<item><bf/Project-User-Manual/ Opens the User manual's index file of your current project. This can be used to review the HTML-output
generated by ksgml2html<p>
<item><bf/About KDevelop.../ Shows the Aboutbox of KDevelop containing the used version number and the authors' names and
email-adresses as well as reference to third-party software used in KDevelop.
</itemize>

<sect>The Help System<label id="The Help System">
<p>
Most of KDevelop's strength is accumulated in the Help System.  It is also to be understood as an example of how to extend your own
KDE application with a complete set of help functionality, and is, in part, already realized in the template applications, so
KDE/Qt application frameworks generated with the KAppWizard do already contain the basic functionality for statusbar help and
documentation, that only has to be extended by the programmer. This section therefore introduces into the usage of the general
help provided within the IDE as well as to show the usage of the Helpbrowser, which, by intelligent use, will make it very easy to
get the information you need for development.

<sect1>The "What's this ?"-Button and Quickhelp
<p>
Looking at KDevelop's top toolbar, you will see the "What's this?" button on the right end. By selecting the button, the cursor
will change to a pointer with a question mark on the right, as is the same as the button in the toolbar. Now, you can select any
visible part of the KDevelop user interface and click on it. This will result in displaying a helpwindow giving you a short
description of the function this part gives you or what it can do for you. Included are the main view, the treeviews and the
toolbars, for which every button help is provided. After another mouseclick or a keyboard input, the What's this? help window
disappears and your cursor is set to the last active position. Mind, that, if you place the mousepointer over a button, it gets
raised and after a short time, you will get a QuickTip-window, describing the function the button represents in the menubar; this
will disappear if you move the mousepointer away.

For user interaction dialogs, Quickhelp provides you help windows with a short description of the selected item you want help for.
These are accessed by a right-button mouseclick to the item, a context-menu pops up that allows the selection of "Quick-Help".
Selecting this will pop up the help window. This is always useful for dialogs where you can't see the action's purpose for as long
as you are not familiar with KDevelop. Mind that most dialogs offer a Help-button which will show you the detailed context-help
for the dialog's options within the provided online-manual in the help-browser.

<sect1> The Statusbar Help
<p>
The statusbar of KDevelop offers you many fuctions that inform you about the current activity state as well as "status messages"
offering a short description for commands.

<sect2> Statusbar Entries
<p>
The Statusbar contains:
<enum>
<item> a general message field, mostleft. This is used for help messages and displays the current activity.
<item> the progressbar, indicating the progress for actions that require a comparably long time to be finished, such as saving
files and the scan-progress of the Class Browser.
<item> an Insert/Overwrite indicator. It shows the editor mode for insert actions by INS for Insert mode and OVR for Overwrite
mode. The mode can be changed by the INS-key on the keyboard.
<item> a line counter, displaying the current line the cursor is placed.
<item> a column counter, indicating the current column position of the cursor in a line.
</enum>

<sect2> Help Messages
<p>
The statusbar informs you about the action of menuentries if you select a menu within the menubar and select an action without
executing it. Further, if you press on a toolbar icon, but without releasing the mousebutton, the help message for the button is
displayed in the same way as for the menuentries. You can prevent the execution of the selected icon by moving the mousepointer
away from the icon, still hoding the button pressed. If the cursor is away, release the mousebutton.

For actions that are currently executed, KDevelop displays the action. This counts for processes running in the background
such as saving files as well as for dialogs. If the process has exited such as a make-invocation, the statusbar display
changes back to "Ready" state.

Also, when using the documentation browser, the statusbar displays link urls for as long as the cursor is placed over an URL link
in the browser window. Therefore, you can easily find out if the file is a local or a remote file only accessed by network
connection.

The caption of the KDevelop Project Editor shows you the currently opened filename in the top window. This would be a HTML file
for the documentation browser or a text file for the editing windows. Further, the Project name is displayed, so you have constant
control where you are and what you're currently working at.

<sect1> Configuring the HTML Browser
<p>
The browser included in KDevelop is completely HTML-based, therefore you can specify the usual options like background and the
like. You can set all preferences by the "Documentation Browser"-entry of the "Options"-menu.
The configuration dialog shows you two tabulators; the first for setting the font preferences, the second for color selection.

<sect2>Font Preferences
<p>
The first option for the font display is the size. Available are small, medium and large. The best display for normal use
is set to small by default.
For the font selection you have to specify a standard font for normal text as it appears in HTML documents; the fixed font is the
one used for dispaying e.g. code within the HTML file.

<sect2>Color Preferences
<p>
The color preferences dialog allows configuration of background, normal text, URL Link and followed link color. The
colored buttons on the right are displaying the current settings; selecting a button will result in opening the "Select Color"
dialog. There, you can specify the color either by choosing a System Color, a custom color, select the color by the multi-colored
window or by setting the values directly. The middle contains a preview for the color selected.

Further, you can specify if the browser should underline links to easier detect them visually and if you like to use your own
colors always independent of the page's preset ones. "Apply" will execute all changes, while "OK" will apply changes and close the
dialog. "Cancel" leaves all settings untouched and exits the configuration.

<sect1> Using the Documentation Browser<label id="Using the Documentation Browser">
<p>
The documentation browser allows quick and easy access to all manuals and documentations that are provided with KDevelop or
generated automatically, including online-documentation for the <idx/KDE-libraries/ and your project documentation. Plus, the
Documentation Tree in the tree-view lets you customize a special "Others" folder that contains all individually added
documentation.

<sect2>Requirements
<p>
To make use of all features of the Helpbrowser, you should have KDoc and glimpse installed. KDoc will generate all kind of online
classdocumentation for the <idx/KDE-libraries/ during the setup process, but can also invoked by option in the <ref id="General
Configuration" name="KDevelop Setup">. For the generation of an API (Application Programming Interface) Documentation for your
project's classes, KDoc is also used and called by the Build-menu, entry "Make API-Doc". This will process all current header files of
the project plus the addition of a cross-reference to the Qt and <idx/KDE-libraries/ if those are available in the Helpbrowser. For the
generation of the project handbooks, you should have ksgml2html (provided with the <idx/KDE-SDK/) and, as a minimum, SGML-tools
installed on your system. To extend and change your project's online-documentation, you have to edit the documentation file for your
project by selecting it in the RFV. After saving your changes, call "Make User-Manual" from the Build-menu. In case sgmltools detect
formatting errors, those will be displayed in the output window allow you to find the error line directly. The program "glimpse"
is used to create a personal search-index for your documentation automatically. The index is generally build during the
installation process, but can also be build with the <ref id="General Configuration" name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog. For a description of
the provided search functions see <ref id="Using the Search Index" name="Using the Search Index">.

<sect2>Provided Documentation
<p>
The KDevelop IDE comes with two sets of online-documentation, which can be accessed either via the Help-menu or by the Doc-tree in
the Tree-View in the KDevelop folder. The first book provided is this online-handbook containing all information you need towards
installation, configuration, available functionality and introduction to application development. The second book is <em/The
KDevelop Programming Handbook/ in it's first edition. The programming handbook covers most questions related to the creation and
extension of projects that work with KDevelop. By tutorials the user gets an introduction to the rich facilities that applications
created with the Qt- and/or <idx/KDE-libraries/ have to offer as well as given a guideline for ensuring <idx/KDE/-compliance, which
covers the same instructions given on the internet site of <htmlurl url="http://developer.kde.org" name="http://developer.kde.org">
However, the programming handbook cannot replace any additonal documentation available in printed or electronic form about the C++
programming language as well as about the usage of the Qt-library in certain terms.

The C/C++-Reference used with KDevelop is currently only available on the KDevelop homepage at <htmlurl
url="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html" name="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html">.
It can be installed easily by downloading and copying the sourcefile to the main KDE-directory ($KDEDIR). There, you have to
untar it as root with <tt/tar zxvf c_c++_reference.tar.gz/, the reference will then be copied the documentation
directory of KDevelop. For uninstalling the reference documentation you just have to delete the "reference" folder under
($KDEDIR)/share/doc/HTML/default/kdevelop/reference.

The Qt/KDE-libraries documentation folder allows direct access to the HTML-online documentation of your copy of the Qt-library.
The path to the library documentation is usually automatically detected by the KDevelop installation program, but can be set
manually in the <ref id="General Configuration" name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog. Also, all available documentation for the KDE-libraries
are listed in order of the library name, so if you would use classes of a certain library it is easy to determine the library type
to be added to the linker settings in the project. Mind that the whole KDE-library documentation is only accessable when generated
by KDoc- so this program, included in the <idx/KDE-SDK/, has to be installed before the documentation can be generated. As the
installation program of KDevelop does this automatically, it should be installed before KDevelop is started for the first time. If
this is not the case and the documentation cannot be build, you are able to create it afterwards at any time with the <ref
id="General Configuration" name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog.

The library documentation tree is followed by the "Others" folder which is inteded to contain all personally customized
documentation as described below. Finally, the Doc-Tree allows access to the Project API and the Project Manual for your current
project.

<sect2>Adding Documentation to the Helpbrowser
<p>
To customize your Helpbrowser, open the Tree-View and select the "DOC" Tabulator. You will see an opened tree called
Documentation, containing four folders. The "Others" folder is, by default, empty. On a right mousebutton click over this folder,
a context menu opens that has an entry "Add Entry". Select this to open the Add Entry dialog where you have to enter two values:
the upper one for the name that will be displayed for the documentation within the Doc-tree, and, below that, a file-entry line.
Here, you have to enter the path and filename to the startpage that will be opened by the selection of the entry later. You can
enter the path and filename directly or by selection of the pushbutton on the right to open a file-chooser dialog. This allows a
quick browsing on your system to the path for your startpage. Mind that only HTML-documentation can be selected, so only HTML
files are allowed to choose. Selecting OK will add the entry to the Doc-tree and is available directly.

<sect2>Using the Search Index<label id="Using the Search Index">
<p>
KDevelop includes a set of fuctions to help you search information within HTML documentation. To use these features, your system
needs to have the program "glimpse", a free database generator, installed, which creates the search index and executes searches
within the documentation. To set up the index, see <ref id="General Configuration" name="KDevelop Setup">, but the index is also
automatically generated during the installation program.

The search functions are available through several ways which you can choose from:
<enum>
<item>in the editor, select the text you want to have help on or place the cursor in the word that you want to look for. Then
press the right mouse button and select look up: "expression" This can also be done by selecting "Search Marked Text" from the
help menu, the shorcut key F2 or by selecting the Search icon from the toolbar.
<item>in the Documentation browser select the text you want to look up and press the right mouse button, select look
up:"expression" or select "Search Marked Text" or the search icon as above.
<item>if you want to search for a specific keyword, select "Search for Help on..." in the help menu or select the "Search for Help
on..." icon from the toolbar, opening a search dialog where you can enter the expression you want to get information for.
</enum>
Direct access to specific documentation is given by selecting the according icon in the "DOC" -tree-view or by the help menu
entries.

<sect>Working with the Editor<label id="Working with the Editor">
<p>
An important part of the integrated development environment is the editor. You're using it for:
<itemize>
<item>creating, opening and saving source and project files
<item>editing source and project files
<item>writing your sgml documentation
<item>printing your project files
</itemize>
Generally, the editor itself doesn't do much difference in comparison to other editors; especially as it is a build-in version of
the popular KWrite, also known as the "Extended Editor". If you're familar with that, you won't have any problems using it for
managing your projects. In addition to normal editors, KDevelop contains a new printing system, that is far more extended for use
with sourcecodes- and you can choose between the printing program you want to use.

This section gives you more information about how to handle your project files and to make you more familiar with the editor's
functionality. A lot of Unix-hardliners would prefer using Emacs or XEmacs- they're fine with that. But it isn't neccessary for
easy programming, and especially for beginners, to work themselves into powerful editors which shall, in the result, only allow
you to enter your code.

<sect1>Managing Project Files
<p>
The following sections describe how to create, save, open and close your project files you need to edit- mind that this doesn't
include translation files or pixmaps. Those are recognized automatically and the according editing program like KTranslator opens
those files for you.

To give you an easy access to your files, KDevelop contains two easy-to-handle treeviews, similar to a filemanager, that recognize
if you selected a file, and opens it in the according editor window. The main view contains two windows that are used
independently, but connected via the Project Editor, so you can do all menubar actions the same way. The intention behind this is
that it allows you to handle two windows at the same time, although only one is visible. The C/C++ window thereby takes another
task, which allows you to easily compile your sources one by one, so you can check the impelmentations without having to run a
complete build-process over your project.

This can be done when having the C/C++ window on top. Select "Compile File" from the Build-menu or press the according button in
the toolbar. Your file gets saved and compiled, and you can control any errors by the compiler output in the output window.

Within the IDE you can open as many textfiles as you like. All opened files are listed in the Window-menu, so you can switch
between them by selecting the according filename from the menu. Further, the actual opened file is displayed with its name in the
window frame of KDevelop.

<sect2>Creating and Saving Files
<p>
To create a new file, choose "New" from the File-menu or select "Add File(s) to project"&rarr"New File". This opens the "New File"
dialog, where you can specify the filename and type. Additionally, you have to set the destination directory as well if the file
is added to the project or not. Finally, you can also use your header template for the project in case you want to add a new
sourcefile without generating a new class by the Class-Generator.

After the file has been created, you can edit the new file as usual; if you have to switch between different files, you can always
turn back to the file either via the file-trees or by the Window-menu.

For saving any changes, KDevelop offers a whole variety of options. The standard way would be to save the file by selecting "Save"
or "Save As" from the File-menu or by the Save-button on the toolbar. For saving all changed files at once, you could as well
select "Save all" from the File-menu.

Now, when working on a project, it is very annoying if something critical happens while you have done a lot of changes on your
files; sometimes you will bite yourself that you have forgotten to save the changes. KDevelop takes care of this by offering
"Autosaving", which is by default enabled and set to save all files in intervalls of 5 minutes. To select another saving period or
to disable this, see <ref id="KDevelop Setup" name="KDevelop Setup">, where the setup options are described.

Additionally, KDevelop takes care for all changes if you open another project or exit KDevelop. You will be asked for saving the
changed files, where you also have the option to specify which one to save and which you want to stay unsaved. Further, when
invoking any build-processes, your files get saved automatically, so you won't ever wonder why your application doesn't run the
way you expected it to do after your changes to the sourcefiles. The only exception is the "Compile File" command, which only
saves the currently opened source file visible in the source editor window.

<sect2>Opening and Closing Files
<p>
To open a source file, you have a lot of options as well. One way could be, as the standard for editors, to select "Open" from the
File-menu. You will be presented an "Open File" dialog, which allows you to choose the file you want to edit. Another, probably
more frequently used way is to select the file from the LFV, the Logical File Viewer, or the RFV, the Real File Viewer (see <ref
id="Overview">). The advantage of the file trees is that they provide a quick visual access to your files, especially the LFV,
which only displays your project files by their type, collected into folders. You can as well configure the LFV towards sorting
your files in another manner by a right mouseclick on the tree. Select "New Group" from the popup-menu, and you can configure a
new group, or select "Edit Group" to install new file filters by specifying the goup's file extensions, separated by commas.

The standard file groups for a project generated by KAppWizard are the Headers, Sources, GNU and Others. Additionally, after
adding a translation file, KDevelop adds a folder "Translations", containing your *.po files.

To close files, select the file to close from the Window-menu, which loads the opened file into the front editor. Then select
"Close" from the File-menu. If your file has been changed, you will be asked to save it. When closing a project, all currently
opened files will be checked for changes and you will be asked for saving as well.

<sect1>Navigating within Files
<p>
The following gives you a general guideline how to locate certain positions within your files for a quicker access.

<bf>&raquo How to find a certain line in a file</bf>

<enum>
<item>Select "Line" in the "View"-menu or press STRG+L. The dialogfiled "Goto Line" appears.
<item>Insert the linenumber you want to go to.
<item>Press OK.
</enum>

<bf>&raquo How to set a bookmark</bf>

<enum>
<item>Set the cursor to the line you want to access via a bookmark
<item>Select "Set Bookmark" from the "Bookmarks"-menu.
<item>A popup-menu opens that allows you to select the bookmark number you want to set for the new bookmark.
<item>Select the bookmark number.
</enum>

Another way to set bookmarks would be to select "Add Bookmark" from the "Bookmarks"-menu. This sets a bookmark to the current line
and appends it to the bookmarks-list.

<bf>&raquo How to delete bookmarks</bf>

The bookmarks are set for each editing window separately- mind that your bookmarks aren't connected to a certain file you set the
bookmark for. To delete all bookmaks, select "Delete Bookmarks" from the "Bookmarks"-menu. This deletes the bookmarks for the
window actually on top, either the Header window or the C++ window.

<bf>&raquo How to go to a bookmarked line</bf>

<enum>
<item>Select the "Bookmarks"-menu and open the popup menu containing the bookmarks for the window containing the bookmark you want
to view; either the C++-Window or the Header-Window entry.
<item>Select the bookmarked line.
</enum>

<sect1>Working with Keyboard Shortcuts
<p>
For using the editor, you should make yourself comfortable with some keyboard shortcuts that make it easier to position the cursor
and edit the file. The complete shortcut reference is also listed in section <ref id="Overview" name="Overview">.

<sect1>Edit Windows Settings
<p>
The editor inside KDevelop can be configured towards special editing needs with a global effect on all editing windows. Thereby
you can set the color modes, highlighting colors (also configurable in reference to the programming language of the file) and
automatic text settings like tab-with and selection modes. The following describes how to set these options by the configuration
dialogs provided in the "Options"-menu.

<sect2>General Settings
<p>
The editor's general settings can be configured with the "Editor" entry in the "Options"-menu. Select the according values and
press OK after you finished with your configuration.

<sect3>Edit Options
<p>
<descrip>
<tag/Auto Indent:/	this sets the edior to place the cursor below the first literal when a new line is entered.
<p>
<tag/Backspace Indent:/ this option sets the cursor below the first literal of the line above when backspace is pressed.
<p>
<tag/Word Wrap:/ words are taken into the next line after the column set in "Wrap Words At:"
<p>
<tag/Replace Tabs:/ tabulators in the current text are replaced with tabulators of the "Tab Width:" value
<p>
<tag/Remove Trailing Spaces:/removes trailing spaces
<p>
<tag/Wrap Cursor:/ sets the cursor to the end of the last line when backspace enters the beginning of a line
<p>
<tag/Auto Brackets:/ creates a closing bracket in front of the cursor when a bracket (any kind) is opened.
</descrip>

<sect3>Select Options
<p>
<descrip>
<tag/Persistent Selections:/ selections made stay marked after setting the cursor to a different place
<p>
<tag/Multiple Selections:/ allows multiple independent selections within the text
<p>
<tag/Vertical Selections:/ when selecting multiple lines, the selection is also made horizontal and doesn't cover the
whole line
<p>
<tag/Delete On Input:/ deletes a selection when writing in the selection.
<p>
<tag/Toggle Old:/ allows only one selection. A selection made gets deselected when another selection is made.
<p>
<tag/Wrap Words At:/ sets the maximum columns that a line can have. The word that contains a letter that reaches over this value
will be automatically broken into the next line.
</descrip>

<sect2>Colors
<p>
For changing the editor's general appearance, you can define a set of colors that the editor uses by selecting "Editor Colors"
from the "Options"-menu. You can configure colors for:
<itemize>
<item><bf/background:      /        the editor's background
<item><bf/text background:  /     	the background of displayed text
<item><bf/selected:         /       the color of selected text to display the selection
<item><bf/found:            /       the color of text found by a search via the menu "View"-"Search", "Repeat search" and "Replace".
<item><bf/selected + found: /       the color of text selected to search for and found
</itemize>

<sect2>Syntax Highlighting
<p>
The syntax-highlighting mode of KDevelop's editor can be configured by two dialogs; first you can set default colors for
syntax-highlihgting by the "Editor Defaults" entry in the "Options"-menu. There, you can set colors and fonts as well as the
fontsize for e.g. keywords. Select the default item and set all needed options.

The second configuration dialog is accessed by the "Syntax-Highlighting" entry in the "Options"-menu. This allows you to set the
file filters for the programming language, e.g. *.cpp, *.h  for C++. Then select the item that you want to configure. If you wish
to use the default values you've set in the "Editor Defaults" dialog, select the "default" checkboxes in the Item-style and
Item-Font sections. This reads the default settings for the selected item. After pressing OK, your new values will be enabled and
used by the editor.

<sect1>Searching and Replacing
<p>
<sect2>Sigle File Search
<p>
<bf>&raquo How to find one or more characters in the actual editing window</bf>
<enum>
<item>Select "Search" from the "Edit"-menu. This opens the search dialog.
<item>Specify the expression to search for in the edit field. The drop-down menu offers selecting a previous search expression.
<item>Select additonal options like "Whole Words only"
<item>Press OK.
</enum>

To repeat searching for an expression entered in the search dialog, press F3.

<sect2>Searching over Several Files

<p>
As the seach function only is referencing seaches over a single file that is currently visible, you're limited to this. But often
you want to search for the same expression overall your project. Therefore, KDevelop contains a <tt/grep/-frontend dialog, which
lets you search over all files that you specify either by setting the directory to start the search from and/or by mime-type.
Specifying the exact directory and the mime-type will therefore reduce the time that KDevelop needs to read your files and display
the results. To start a search over several files, select "Search in files..." from the "Edit"-menu. The seach dialog opens and
lets you enter:

<itemize>
<item>The expression to search for (the pattern)
<item>The template used for the search
<item>The mime-type of files to search in
<item>The directory to start form
<item>If the search is recursive over all included subdirectories
</itemize>

You can even extend your search pattern by using the following options:

<enum>
<item><bf/./ Match any character
<item><bf/^/ Match the beginning of a line
<item><bf/$/ Match the end of a line
<item><bf/\< / Match the beginning of a word
<item><bf/\> / Match the end of a word
</enum>

For a repeating search, you can also use the availabel operators:
<enum>
<item><bf/?/ The preceding item matches less than once
<item><bf/*/ The preceding item is matched zero or more times
<item><bf/+/ The preceding item is matched once or more times
<item><bf/{ n }/ The preceding item is matched exactly <em/n/ times
<item><bf/{ n,}/ The preceding item is matched <em/n/ or more times
<item><bf/{,n }/ The preceding item matches less than <em/n/ times
<item><bf/{n,m}/ The preceding item matches at least <em/n/ times but less than <em/m/ times
</enum>

Backreferences to bracketed subexpressions are also available by the notation <em/\n/.

After specifying your search, press "Search". The results are then displayed in the result-window. To jump to a file and line
number, select the resultline and press Enter or double click the result. The editor will automatically open the according file
and place the cursor to the line of the result. This allows a complete specification for any search action and give out exact
results.

<sect2>Searching within Documentation
<p>
While working on a project, you often need to have information about the parameters of member functions you want to use- most
often you remember the function's name that matches your needs, but the parameters are a very hard thing to keep in mind.
Therefore, and for other purposes that may occur, KDevelop contains a search functionality that combines searching expressions
that appear in your files with the documentation browser. To make use of this search functionality, you should have set up the
documentation browser correctly and created the search database. For invoking a search through the documentation, do the
following:

<enum>
<item>place your cursor at the word you want to search or mark an expression
<item>select "Search Marked Text" from the "Help"-menu or press the right mouse button to open the context menu; then select "Look
Up: "expression".
<item>after the search result page is displayed in the documentation browser, select the page that you think could contain the
information you need.
<item>the selected documentation page is displayed and your search result is marked. To display the next result within the same
documentation page, press F3.
</enum>

This allows you to easily find the information you need. For using the results, the documentation browser allows marking a
selection and copying it to the clipboard. Then return to the file you're editing and select "Paste" from the "Edit"-menu.

For a full description on how to use the Documentation, see <ref id="Using the Search Index" name="Using the Search Index">.

<sect2>Replacing Text
<p>
For replacing an expression, select "Search and Replace" from the "Edit"-menu. The "Search and Replace"-dialog lets you specify
the expression to be replaced as well as the replacement expression. Then press OK. The first expression which is found will be
marked, so you can see where the expression is and in which context. Then you can specify by a dialog if the expression shall be
replaced or not. When the search is finished by reaching the end of the current file, you will be asked if you want to start the
search again from the beginning. If you're finished, select "Cancel".

<sect1>Printing
<p>
As KDevelop is designed to give developers the best access to files and information to reduce development cycles, it also contains
a new printing utility which makes use of two common printing programs available for Unix-Systems, <em/a2ps/ (ASCII-to-Postscript) and
<em/enscript/. Besides these, you can also print by directly using lpr (the lineprinter device). As using a2ps or enscript offers the
most options towards printing, you should install either one of these on your system; both programs are usually shipped with
distributions, so you shouldn't have any problem to get them. But before printing, you should have a look at the available
configuration dialogs to prepare the output according to your needs. The following section describes how to configure KDevelop for
printing files.

<sect2>Configuring the Printer
<p>
The printing programs can both be configured by selecting "Print" from the "File"-menu; on the printing dialog, select the program
by the drop-down-menu in the left upper corner. Then press the "Options" button on the right. This opens the configuration for the
selected program that will be used. Another way to configure the programs are selecting "Printer Configuration..." from the
"Options"-menu; then select "a2ps" or "enscript".

<sect3>The a2ps Configuration Options
<p>
<sect4>Printing
<p>
<itemize>
<item><bf/header:/  adds a header frame to the page
<item><bf/filename:/  if checked, the header frame will contain the filename as its text
<item><bf/login:/  adds the User ID to the right upper corner of the page
<item><bf/borders:/  adds frame borders to the text page
<item><bf/Date & Time:/  adds the printing date and time
<item><bf/align files:/  prints out files on the same page, available for two-page printing mode
<item><bf/set TAB size:/  sets the TAB size for printing TABs
<item><bf/headertext:/ available, if filename is deselected and allows inserting another text to the header frame
<item><bf/fontsize:/  sets the fontsize for the text. The default fontsize is 9
</itemize>

<sect4>Textprinting
<p>
<itemize>
<item><bf/cut lines:/  cuts the line's contents if the line is too large to be printed. If deselected, lines will be broken.
<item><bf/interpret TAB, BS and FF:/ interpret TAB, Backspace and FastForward characters.
<item><bf/replace non-printing character by space:/ if the file contains non-printable characters, those will be replaced by space
characters.
<item><bf/print non-ASCII character as ISO-Latin 1:/ prints characters not included in the ASCII format in ISO-Latin 1 mode output
<item><bf/bold font:/ prints the whole text in bold font mode.
</itemize>

<sect4>Numbering
<p>
<itemize>
<item><bf/numbering lines:/  numbers all lines top-down if enabled
<item><bf/numbering pages:/ allows selecting page-numbering mode by:
<itemize>
<item><bf/file single:/ numbers each file's pages beginning with 1
<item><bf/file together:/  appends all following pages after the first for page numbering
</itemize>
<item><bf/lines per page:/  sets the maximum lines per page to be printed.
</itemize>

<sect3>The enscript Configuration Options
<p>
<sect4>Header
<p>

<sect3>Print Preview
<p>
Print Preview is available for you to control how the output will look like. Therefore, KDevelop uses the program <em/ghostview/ or
<em/kghostview/. When the preview-button was pressed on either printing dialog, you will be presented a template output that shows you
the effect of the currently set options.

<sect>Projects<label id="Projects">
<p>

<sect1>Projecttypes
<p>

<sect2>Programs
<p>
KDevelop creates a projectfile with the .kdevprj ending. This file contains all your project information, so be careful not to
delete it. It is stored in the project's base directory and has to be opened to load the project. The projectfile keeps all
information for your files like the file properties, install path, distribution status and compiler options (CXXFLAGS). Setting
file properties allows you to keep track of where the files should go.

With KAppWizard, you can create a new application project according to your choice of application type. For now, KAppWizard
generates three kinds of fram applications, as:

<itemize>
<item>a single document interface (SDI) <idx/KDE/-application including a menubar, a toolbar and a statusbar. It contains basic control
resource management to allow extending the frame application into a unique <idx/KDE/ application. The application frame also
contains statusbar help messages as known from commercial products just like KDevelop itself. From the programmer's point of view,
it is based on three application-specific classes leaning on the MVC-concept (Model-View-Controller). Technically, the base
classes may not be viewed that way, but it's construction is at least created most logical to create applications with a GUI.

<item>a <idx/KDE/-based application frame window. This application type offers most flexibility to those wanting to develop their
program from scratch, but can also be used as a basis for developing wizard applications or modules.

<item>a Qt-only based program framework. For those programmers who want to use the Qt library as the GUI interface alone, we
tried to offer you a smart framework to support your application development. As Qt programming is fully supported, you should
have no problems to create a full-functional application by using Qt only.

<item>a C++ program framework. This application type is intended for those wanting to write a terminal based C++ program. Just
remove the "Hello World" line in main() and construct your classes the same way with KDevelop as for <idx/KDE/ applications.
</itemize>
For importing existing applications, we suggest using the New Project option. Select "Project" from the menubar and select "New".
The New Project dialog offers creates a project directory and subdirectories as well as the project file with the project name and
type. We advise copying all needed creation files like configure.in, Makefile.am's etc. into the project directory from your
existing project and choose "Project"&rarr"Add file(s)"&rarr"Add existing file(s)" to copy the sources into your new project directory.
Note that your Makefile.am's will be changed by KDevelop and you probably will have to change or delete some entries to provide
clean compilation. You should not edit the KDevelop write area, instead you should read the entries made by KDevelop and delete
matching titles created yourself. Also note that only one project is supported to work on at the moment, so your source files
should be in the project's subdirectory which has the same name as the main project directory. In the Logical File Viewer the
groups have to be set by yourself if you chose to use that importing possibility. Another way could be to create a frame
application and delete the created source and header files. Then you can add existing files as above.

<sect2>Libraries
<p>

This type of project isn't supported at the moment. This will be another feature planned to be integrated in later versions of
KDevelop.

<sect2>Multiple Targets
<p>

For some projects, the facilities of KDevelop at it's current state will not last. Those are projects that include multiple
targets like packages containing several applications. As commands like "Execute" or the Class Browser require that only one
target is build by the developer, those types of projects are only supported in the way that you have to write your own entries to
the Makefiles and build your directories for the additional libraries or binaries to build. Nevertheless, a build-process always
invokes your make-program independent from what actually the targets are; so these functions still can be used.

Another way to still work with this type and to still have access to the binaries themselves are creating empty projects and move
their subdirectories in conjunction with the project files to the directory containing all sources later. Then you could load each
target independently by its project file; this also allows executing and debugging the target.

<sect1> New Projects
<p>

The KDevelop Application Wizard allows the creation of four different types of projects, constructing a
framework for each. All projects are FSF-compliant and use the GNU standard development tools as described in the requirements
section of this handbook. For <idx/KDE/ applications, the wizard offers two different frameworks, the <idx/KDE/-Application, providing
a complete application with base classes for document type, view and application. This includes the creation of a menubar, toolbar
and statusbar, the mainwindow inherits the KTMainWindow class. The <idx/KDE/-Mini-Application only gives a view which is empty. This
type of project can be used for the creation of small desktop tools or other simple applications without too much change on the
existing code provided by the framework. A Qt-Application offers the creation of a <idx/Qt/-only program if you wish no dependencies
towards the KDE-libraries for end-users. (NOTE: The configure script still checks for the <idx/KDE-libraries/.  This will be fixed in
the next version of KDevelop).	
The Qt-Application also is created by using tree base classes like the KDE-standard-Application and provides a menubar, toolbar
and statusbar.

The C++ -Application type offers a framework for creating commandline applications.  It is ready to run and by default displays
"Hello World" as the only action.  This may be useful for C++ learners who would like to program applications without using a GUI
first or for those working on commandline programs written in C++ or C.

The wizard asks for your project name, version and the location where the project directory will be build.  Furher, your Name and
Email adress are asked for inserting them in header and cpp templates on top of your source files as well as for entries in the
*.lsm file.

<sect1>Opening and Closing of Projects
<p>
KDevelop is by default configured to open the last project loaded when starting. This allows a fast start, but you may want to
change that to just start the IDE without any project. To prevent the default behavoir, disable the "Load last project" option in
the <ref id="KDevelop Setup" name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog.

To open another project, select "Open" from the "Project" menu or press the "Open Project" button on the toolbar. In case you've
got another project currently open, this will be closed. If your current project then contains files that aren't saved, you are
asked to save all changed files. Thereby, you can select which file to save and which you want to close without saving, or to save
all at once.

Then you get an "Open Project" dialog, where you can change to the directory containing the project file to be loaded. KDevelop
project files have the <em/*.kdevprj/ mime-type which is also displayed by a project icon. Select the project file and press
"Open". When loading a project, the Class Browser scans all files and builds the initial classtree, so you can start working on the
project by using the Class Browser directly.

Another comfortable way to open a project is to select the project file in the KFM, the <idx/KDE/ File Manager. This will start
KDevelop with loading the selected project file. You could as well open a project by commandline, entering <tt/kdevelop
projectname.kdevprj/.

When closing KDevelop, your project file will be saved automatically and the IDE detects if you have changed any projectfiles.
Then you will be asked to save any changes before exiting. The available options for closing are the same than for closing a
project before loading another.

<sect1>Editing a Project
<p>
After you created a new project with the KAppWizard, the usual task is to extend the project by editing the already created
sources and adding classes, pixmaps, pictures and whatelse you project needs. Now, editing a project means that you can change the
default project after its generation by menus and dialogs according to your needs. The next section therefore describes how you
can add existing files and classes as well as creating new files. This is needed for building your project, but this won't help
you for the installation process by the end-user. Therefore, section <ref id="Setting Project File Options" name="Setting Project File
Options"> describes how to set File Properties especially for additional files that you want make to install, like documentation or
pixmaps.
Another part in project maintaining is adding translations for applications that support internationalization, which is described
in <ref id="Adding Translations" name="Adding Translations">.

<ref id="Extending the Project Documentation" name="Extending the Project Documentation"> covers questions on how to create a good set
of documentation for online help enabling the end-user to help himself in case of troubles as well as how to use your product.

Finally, <ref id="Project Hacking" name="Project Hacking"> describes how you can eventually work around the KDevelop project
management in special cases.

<sect2>Adding and Removing Files and Classes<label id="Adding Files and Classes">
<p>
Adding a new file is often used when you think that you should separate your class implementation file into several ones. Then you
need to create an new file which will contain the part of the class implementation you want to move. You can do this by choosing
"New" from the "File" menu, opening the "New File" dialog. This enables you to specify the file-type, name and the location. When
entering the filename, KDevelop automatically enters the extension for you, but you can as well change the extensions towards your
own preferences. Further, you can include the header template for sourcefiles, so you don't have to copy this into your new file
yourself. Also, you can decide, if the file is included in the project or not. Mind that this doesn't cover the installation
destination; this has to be configured later by setting the file preferences.

After the new file has been created, the project file will be updated as well as the according Makefile.am's.
To add a complete class to your project, you can constuct a new class with the Classgenerator which is invoked by "New Class" from
the Project-menu.

In case you have an existing project and you want to add certain classes that you want to re-use in your project, select "Add
File(s) to Project..." from the Project-menu. Select "Add existing files", which will open a dialog to let you specify which files
will be added to the project and the destination directory. Mind that the files will be copied into the specified directory and
added to the project. You should call "Make" after adding sources; then your added files will be included in the build-process. In
case you want to add e.g. pixmaps that have to be installed by the end-user, you should update the File Properties for the added
file and specify the installation path (see <ref id="Setting Project File Options" name="Setting Project File Options">

To add a file to the project that is already in the project directory, go to the RFV, where all project-included files are
dispayed by their project status by a red ! over the file icon. Select the file you want to add to the project (which has a normal
file icon) and press the right mouse button to get the popup-menu. Then select "Add".

Files can also be removed from your project. This could be needed in cases where you don't want to use pre-generated files that
are already given by the KAppWizard. To remove a file, you have additionally the option between removing a file from the project
or delete it completely. To remove a file from the project, select the file in the LFV or the RFV, press the right mouse button
and select "remove". To delete a file, select "delete physically".

<sect2>Setting Project File Options<label id="Setting Project File Options">
<p>
The file properties dialog can be accessed via the project menu or within the LFV by a right mouseclick.  It shows the project
files in groups as they are sorted in the LFV and displays the file properties like file size, file type and if the file is
included in the project as well as the installation path if the file is going to be installed by the end-user's make install
command.  It is important for documentation files as well as pixmaps to specify the location where the files should go when the
project is build and installed by end users, so you have to set up those locations. For standard <idx/KDE/ location macros you should
look in your Makefile.am where the location macros are specified.


<sect2>Adding Translations<label id="Adding Translations">
<p>
As <idx/KDE/ allows configuring your desktop and the behavoir of your applications, you also have the option to choose the language
that your application uses, in regards of the use of online-documentation as well as the application's look. For documentation files,
this seems a trivial task. You would add a subdirectory labeled by the desired language, e.g. <tt/de/ for german, to the
<tt/docs/ directory of your project and copy the english documentation into that directory. Then you would generate the
documentation and set all project file options for the installation directories. Then you could start translating the sgml file to
your desired language and regenerate the documentation; then you're done.
For the application, this seems a bit more difficult for the programmer. Now, we want to explain how to enable
internationalization support for your application and how to add the languages you want to support.

First, you have to enclose all visible strings of your application that appear in bars or dialogs with the <tt/i18n()/ macro.
This macro is a replacement for the function <tt/klocale->tranlate()/ of the KLocale class and much easier to use. As this macro
is declared in the <tt/kapp.h/ include file, you have to add <tt/#include &lt;kapp.h&gt;/ to the source file or the class
declaration file of the class that makes use of the macro. Also it should be mentioned, that although <tt/i18n()/ is a macro and
therefore you could think about using the original function, this won't work because the strings that are set up for translation
have to be read out of the sources and get stored in the application's translation file (&lt;YourApp&gt;.pot in the /po
subdirectory). This task is done by the program xgettext, and to do this, you would enter <tt/make messages/ in your prject
directory containing the sources. As xgettext depends on the <tt/i18n()/ macro, the original function won't do the job.

For translations themselves, you first have to create the message file containing all strings that are used in your sources with
the <tt/i18n()/ macro. This can be done by choosing "Make Messages and merge" from the Build-menu.
Then you have to add the languages that your application wants to support. Therefore, select "Add Tranlation File" from the
Project-menu. This opens a language selection dialog. Select the language and press OK. This will build the ASCII file containing
entries for the filename of the string and the line where the original string is placed. Then you will see a <tt/msgid/ line
containing the string to translate, followed by <tt/msgstr/. The msgstr line is mostly empty except for the translations already
provided by the <idx/KDE-libraries/. Those have to be filled with the according translations of your language.

You could think about writing the translations by hand, which can also be done. But the <idx/KDE-SDK/ offers the use of the program
KTranslator, which ready the already existing files from other applications installed on the system, so you can reuse already
translated strings to support your language.

To access KTranslator, the easiest way is selecting a &lt;language&gt;.po file in the /po directory either in the LFV or in the
RFV. This opens KTranslator and lets you do the translating easiely. Mind that you have to set up KTranslator's properties
yourself to include the author name and the language as well as the destination file. KTranslator by default only opens your
translation file.

For all translation files, <tt/make/ uses the program <tt/msgfmt/ to format your message files to use with the binary, but you
don't have to take care for that, as well as specifying the destination directory for installing the translation files; this is
all done by KDevelop automatically.

For more information about internationalization support, see <htmlurl url="http://www.kde.org" name="http://www.kde.org">; a lot
of people are doing translations for you to support their language. You will find a list of email-adresses of the translators you
could write to and who will help you with this. Also read <ref id="The Dialog Editor" name="The Dialog Editor"> and <em/The KDevelop
Programming Handbook/ where questions about internationalization are covered again.

<sect2>Extending the Project Documentation<label id="Extending the Project Documentation">
<p>
All projects created with KDevelop contain a pre-configured documentation, which already contains standard chapters for
installation, project name and version as well as the author name and email-address. As KDevelop uses SGML-templates, it's very
easy to extend the documentation to a full descriptive helpsystem. The only thing you have to do is editing the sgml file, placed
in docs/en as index.sgml. The reference documentation included with your sgml-tools package can be added to the helpbrowser and
allow you direct access to special tags as well as a short description of how to extend the documentation. SGML has a lot of
advantages, whereas <idx/KDE/ makes wide use by this documentation type with the additional ksgml2html tool. This creates the typical
<idx/KDE/-style documentation and makes it look nicer. Anyway, the sgmltools alone are enough to produce a html output that is already
included in your application. To create the documents using ksgml2html, install the tool and run "Make User-Manual" from the
Build-menu. The Documentation Browser allows a direct controlling of the output by selecting "Project User-Manual" from the
Help-menu or the according icon in the DOC-tree. Then you can browse the documentation online in KDevelop and have a better
overview by the output over errors that result in missing tags.

Now, while extending the documentation, you can't avoid that additional files are produced that have to be included into the
project as each <tt/sect/-tag creates a new HTML file. The output generated by the KAppWizard is already included in the project,
so you don't have to care for their installation path. What you have to watch out for is any index-xx.html file, where xx is
higher than 6 (as the first six pages are already included in the project). After generating the documentation, switch to the RFV
and browse to your documentation directory. Press the right mouse button over the files to add and select "Add". Further,
ksgml2html adds the <idx/KDE/ logo to the documentation directory. This file, <tt/logotp3.gif/, has to be added to the project as well.
Then you have to select the "File Properties" either from the Project menu or by the popup menu in the file-viewers. The easiest
way to set the installation path is to select a documentation file already set up for installation such as <tt/index.html/. You
see that <tt/Install/ is checked and the Installdir+filename already contains the destination. Mark the Installdir and enter
CTRL+C to copy the installation path to the clipboard. Then select the file you want to specify for installation. Enable
<tt/Install/, this will enable the installdir-entry field, already containing the filename. Place the cursor in front of the
filename and enter CTRL+V to insert the clipboard contents (which was the installation path copied before). This is the fastest
way to specify the installation path. For more options about specifying installation destinations, see <em/The KDevelop
Programming Handbook/.

<sect2>Project Hacking<label id="Project Hacking">
<p>
When working with a project, you should never edit the project file by hand. This will prevent KDevelop from loading your project
correctly under certain circumstances, as well as changes will not result in updating the Makefiles. To change any settings for
your project, you have to use the given menuentries like e.g. for adding files or setting file properties. For experts that are
not comfortable with certain options for e.g. the linker or need additional project configuration, you should work yourself into
the Makefile.am macros and add all changes in the Makefile.am's after the section separated with the entry "KDevelop write area".
As the GNU-tools are using the commands at the end of all macro files, you can overwrite KDevelop's settings with this. Mind that
this will prevent using KDevelop for any changes related to project configuration.

<sect1>Compiler and Linker Flags for Projects
<p>
Each new project contains all needed options for the compiler and linker as well as general settings. By default, your project
is set to use debugging by the -g flag, and warnings are set to the standard, -Wall. This ensures you can debug your application
and detect constructions that may cause program errors. For some applications, you would need additional compiler or linker flags,
especially if you're using libraries that are not currently included by the linker. Then you need to update the project by
configuring the correct settings with the Project Options dialog. See <ref id="Build Settings" name="Build Settings"> for more
information how and where to set Compiler Options, Warnings and Linker Options.

<sect1>External Projects
<p>
Existing projects can be converted to KDevelop projects by selecting "New" from the project menu.  The following dialog creates an
empty project file with your project name, version and type information as well as your name and email adress.  Then copy all your
compilation and construction files to the new project directory and choose "Add Files" from the project menu.  The files selected
will be copied into your project directory and the makefile.am's are updated.   Please change all Makefile.am entries existing
before the conversion towards the now created entries done by KDevelop in the KDevelop area.  Test, if your program can still be
compiled and installed after the conversion to ensure the project's consistancy.

<sect>Build Settings<label id="Build Settings">
<p>
The Project Options dialog, accessed by the project menu, lets you specify all needed parameters for your project. Those will be
used for the Makefile.am's and the configure.in script (e.g. version number change or compiler warnings ) and thereby set the
compilation preferences as well.. After changing the project options, you should invoke "make clean" or "rebuild all" to compile
your project with the new options. Please mind that debugging is only available if the project options are set to create debugging
information, the amount can be set with the debug level (0-3). If you add functions that belong to a library that is not included
in the linker flags, your program will not link correctly if those are not updated, so keep track of your library linking.

For a release build of your application or for distributing the sourcecode package, you should watch the following standard
settings:

<itemize>
<item>disable debugging
<item>enable optimization and set optimization level to <bf/-02/
<item>set the compiler warnings to <bf/-Wall/
<item>for each new release, increase the version number and update the project.lsm file for version and requirements.
</itemize>

<sect1>General Options
<p>
The first page of the Project Options dialog sets the general options for your project. These are project name and number, the
handbook sgml file which is used for generating a set of HTML files that are included in the project and specific information
about the author. The short description field is for additional information that you want to include like the program's purpose
and the like.

<sect1>Compiler Options<label id="Compiler Options">
<p>
The compiler options page sets the compiler flags towards your target, debugging and additional.

<sect2>Target
<p>
The target box contains three options that can be set:

Target Machine: You have the choice to set the target machine option here by choosing between your machine (default) and i386v,
which is the option if you configured your compiler as a cross-compiler for an Intel 386-compatible machine running System V. This
option sets the -b flag to the compiler. Usually you would leave this to the default.

only syntax-check: If checked, the -fsyntax-only flag is set. This means that the compiler will check your code only for
correctness in regards to the syntax, but doesn't check anything beyond that.

Optimize: You can enable optimization for your build process by this option, meaning to set the -O flag. If not checked, the flag
is set to -O0, so no optimization will be used. If you enable optimization by checking this option, you can as well specify the
optimization level below from 1 to 3.

For a release version of your application, enable optimization and set the level to 2.

<sect2>Debugging
<p>
Right of the Target box, you can see the Debugging-section. This means that you can set your compiler to include information for
debuggers within the final binary, so the programmer can follow the execution of the application with the debugger in direct
context to the sourcecode.

Enable debugging therefore sets the -g flag; the debugging level specifies the amount of information to be included in the binary.
Availabel are level 1 to 3 to choose from. Mind that the binary execution will be slower by setting any debugging option and that
the binary size will increase by the debugging level.

Generate extra information for gprof: sets the -pg flag, resulting that the compiler will include information for the gprof
program that displays caller graphs of your program's function.

Store temporary intermediate files: sets the -save-temps flag. This will result in storing the usually temporary files produced by
the preprocessor and the assembler. A compilation of a sourcefile will therefore produce three output files: an *.o file which is
the final output of the compiler, an *.i file produced by the preprocessor and an *.s file as the output of the assembler.

For a release of your project, disable any debugging.

<sect2>Additional Options
<p>
The text entry field on the bottom is intended for you to manually set any flags for the compiler by setting the CXXFLAGS
environment variable in the makefiles, so make sets the flags before the build process and reset them afterwards. For a complete
description of all available compiler flags you should see your compiler documentation; for gcc and egcs this can be done by
<bf/man gcc/; <bf/man g++/ will show you information about the c++ script that is used to lead the compiler.


<sect1>Compiler Warnings<label id="Compiler Warnings">
<p>
The following gives a desciption about the compiler warning options that can be set on page 3 of the project options dialog. The
explanations are taken from the man page for GCC, egcs version 1.1.1.
The warnings themselves are diagnostic messages that indicate that constructions may cause errors.

<descrip>
<tag/-Wall/Standard `-W' options combined.
<p>
<tag/-W/ Compile with -W. This option sets options not included in -Wall which are very specific. Please read GCC-Info for more
information.
<p>
<tag/-Wtraditional/Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and ANSI C.
<p>
<tag/-Wundef/"Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an `#if' directive.
<p>
<tag/-Wshadow/Warn whenever a local variable shadows another local variable.
<p>
<tag/-Wid-clash-LEN/Warn whenever two distinct identifiers match in the first len characters. This may help you prepare a program
that will compile with certain obsolete, brain-damaged compilers.
<p>
<tag/-Wlarger-then-LEN/Warn whenever an object of larger than LEN bytes is defined.
<p>
<tag/-Wpointer-arith/Warn about anything that depends on the size of a function type or of void. GNU C assigns these types a
size of 1, for convenience in calculations with void * pointers and pointers to functions.
<p>
<tag/-Wbad-function-cast/Warn whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching type. Forexample, warn if <tt/int malloc()/ is
cast to <tt/anything *./
<p>
<tag/-Wcast-equal/Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from the target type. For example, warn if a
const char * is cast to an ordinary char *.
<p>
<tag/-Wcast-align/Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the target is increased. For example, warn
if a char * is cast to an int * on machines where integers can only be accessed at two- or four-byte boundaries.
<p>
<tag/-Wwrite-strings/Give string constants the type const char[length] so that copying the address of one into a non-const char *
pointer will get a warning. These warnings will help you find at compile time code that can try to write into a string constant,
but only if you have been very careful about using const in declarations and prototypes. Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance;
this is why we did not make `-Wall' request these warnings.
<p>
<tag/-Wconversion/Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what would happen to the same argument in the absence of a
prototype. This includes conversions of fixed point to floating and vice versa, and conversions changing the width or signedness
of a fixed point argument except when the same as the default promotion.
<p>
<tag/-Wsign-compare/Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce an incorrect result when the signed
value is converted to unsigned.
<p>
<tag/-Waggregate-return/Warn if any functions that return
structures or unions are defined or called. (In languages where you can return an array, this also elicits a warning.)
<p>
<tag/-Wmissing-prototypes/ Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype declaration. This warning is issued even if the definition
itself provides a prototype. The aim is to detect global functions that fail to be declared in header files.
<p>
<tag/-Wmissing-declarations/ Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration. Do so even if the definition
itself provides a prototype. Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in header files. -Wredundant-decls
Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes nothing.
<p>
<tag/-Wredundant-decls/Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope even in cases where multiple declaration is
valid and changes nothing.
<p>
<tag/-Wnested-externs/Warn if an extern declaration is encountered within an function.
<p>
<tag/-Winline/Warn if a function can not be inlined, and either it was declared as inline, or else the -fin*line-functions option was given.
<p>
<tag/-Wold-style-cast/Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast is used within a program
<p>
<tag/-Woverloaded-virtual/(C++ only.) In a derived class, the definitions of virtual functions must match the type signature of a
virtual function declared in the base class. Use this option to request warnings when a derived class declares a function that may
be an erroneous attempt to define a virtual function: that is, warn when a function with the same name as a virtual function in
the base class, but with a type signature that doesn't match any virtual functions from the base class.
<p>
<tag/-Wsynth/Warn when g++'s synthesis behavoir does not match that of cfront.
<p>
<tag/make all warnings into errors/(-Werror) Treat warnings as errors; abort compilation after any warning.
<p>
</descrip>

For a release of your project, it is recommended to enable <bf/-Wall/.

<sect1>Linker Options<label id="Linker Options">
<p>
The Linker Options for your current project can be set by the last page of the project options dialog. You have to enable those
libraries that your application uses to link them to your binary with the linker, e.g. your application uses the class
KFileDialog. As the class KFileDialog is part of the KFile library, you have to enable kfile. For classes or functions that are
not listed as checkboxes, use the <bf/"additonal libraries"/ field.

<sect2>Linker Flags
<p>
<descrip>
<tag/remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable:/ This means that all redundant information will be
removed from the object files and the binary, resulting that debugging will not be possible. For as long as your application is in
a development stage and not released as final, you should leave this option disabled.

<tag/prevent using shared libraries:/ This option disables the use of shared libraries on systems that support this. On systems
using no shared libraries, this option will have no effect.

<tag/additional flags:/ Here, you can enter additional flags for the linker, setting the LDFLAGS environment variable by make. The
available options can be taken from the man page for <bf/ld/ or your compiler manpage.
</descrip>

<sect2>Libraries
<p>
The libraries section contains checkboxes for the most needed libraries in conjuction with <idx/Qt//<idx/KDE/ application
development. You have to enable those libraries that your application uses, otherwise the linker will complain about unresolved
symbol tables.
<descrip> <tag/X11/The X11 library. Recommended for all X-Window programs.
<p>
<tag/Xext/The X11 extension library. Also most X-Window programs depend on Xext.
<p>
<tag/qt/The Qt library. Recommended for <idx/Qt/ and <idx/KDE/ applications.
<p>
<tag/kdecore/The KDE Core library; contains the classes for KDE Application frameworks.
<p>
<tag/kdeui/The KDE User Interface library; contains KDE-specific widgets.
<p>
<tag/khtmlw/The KHTML Widget library.
<p>
<tag/kfm/The KFM library containing classes for KFM functions.
<p>
<tag/kfile/The KFile library. Contains file dialogs etc.
<p>
<tag/kspell/The KSpell library. Contains an interface for programs to use ISpell for spellchecking.
<p>
<tag/kab/The KAdressBook library. Needed for access to the adressbook as well as providing adressbook widgets
<p>
</descrip>
<bf/additional libraries:/ Here you can enter additional libraries that your application needs, e.g. the KOM library. Set the
libraries with the -l option; for the example -lkom.

<sect>The Class Browser<label id="The Class Browser">
<p>
<sect1>The Classviewer
<p>
The KDevelop Classviewer is one of the most useful and important tools that the IDE provides a developer for managing his project
sources. When a project is loaded, a classparser reads all project sources for functions, classes etc., then displays the results in
the CV treeview. This chapter shows you how to use the Classviewer and the provided functionality and how it can improve your work.

<sect2>Available Objects
<p>
By available objects, we describe a term that means that C++ code can be seen as a collection of objects- classes, their members,
global functions and the like. The classtree displays these objects logically and orders them by character, so they are easy to locate
in the tree as well by their according icon. Therefore the classtree contains a "Classes" and a "Globals" folder. Thereby the "Classes"
folder generally contains the project's classes; if your project contains subfolders to manage your sourcefiles, these are also
displayed by their original folder name and contain all classes that are stored in the files located in the subfolder.

Further, when popping up a class, the classtree displays the class contents by separating methods and attributes. As these can have
attributes as well like public, private and protected, these are displayed by modified icons as well. You see that a class displayed in
the Class Browser contains all the objects that are present in the class declaration.

Now, classes are a very common thing when programming in C++ and will contain most of the code. But applications also contain objects
that have a "Global" appearance to the program. These would be structs, functions etc. Especially the <tt/main()/ function appears in
every application and you need to modify it in one or the other way sometimes. To access these objects, the Classviewer provides the
"Globals" folder, containing subfolders for the following object types:
<itemize>
<item>Structs
<item>Functions
<item>Variables
</itemize>

As the icons displaying these items are similar to those used in the class-viewer, their meaning is easy to guess and to remember by
the programmer.

Finally, it can be stated that the classviewer displays your project graphically by their objects related to their appearance in the
code. In the following section you will learn how to use the classviewer and it's tools in conjunction with your code.

<sect2>Browsing Object Declarations and Implementations
<p>
The Classviewer's best strength is providing a fast and good access to his code by the code's contents independent of the location
within files. Therefore, selections by a mouse click will result in the following actions:

<itemize>
<item><bf/On a classname:/  Switches to the class declaration
<item><bf/On a class method:/ Switches to the method implementation
<item><bf/On a class attribute:/ Switches to the attibute's declaration in the class declaration
<item><bf/On a struct:/ Switches to the struct's declaration
<item><bf/On a global function:/ Switches to the function's implementation
</itemize>

Now, this provides you the most needed access towards code objects. Apparently, it may be needed to change a method's header, resulting
that you have to change it's declaration in the class as well as the implementation. The classviewer supports this by providing
right-button context menus over items. On a method or function, this means that you can select where to go:

<itemize>
<item><bf/Go to definition:/ Switches to the implementation- this is the default for a left click as described above
<item><bf/Go to declaration:/ Switches to the declaration of the method or function.
</itemize>

By this behavoir, the Class Browser offers you access to every place you have to go for coding your C++ application.

The following sections give you a description of the other tools that the Class Browser offers- you will find them very useful when
working with large projects as they enhance working object-orientated on C++ programs.

<sect1>The Classtools
<p>
The classtools are dialogs that makes it even more easier for the developer to get more information about his project's classes. As the
classviewer displays all objects by their occurence in the code, you sometimes want to get more information about classes without
having to look inside the code. Therefore, the classtool dialogs are specified on displaying specific class attributes.

The classtool dialog is invoked by the popup menu over a class in the classviewer. Select "Classtool", and the dialog will appear.
To get informed about a class, select the class in the combo box on top. Then the buttons in the toolbar provide functions that give
you specific trees for your class. These are:

<descrip>
<tag/ Parents:/
The parents of the selected class, which means the class it iherits. This is useful for multiple iheritance as well as to see why a
class behaves in one or the other way, e.g. for dialogs your parent class could be <em/QWidget/ or <em/QDialog/.
<tag/Children:/
Displays the children classes that inherit the current class.
<tag/Clients:/
Classes that make use of the selected class by an attribute in their class declaration
<tag/Suppliers:/
The suppliers that give attributes to the selected class.
<tag/Attributes:/ The attributes of the class by their name
<tag/Methods:/ The Methods of the selected class
<tag/Virtual Methods:/ The virtual methods that a class provides
</descrip>
Further, the selection of the attribute public, protected, private or all shows Attributes, Methods and Virtual Methods by their
attribute value.

<sect1>Managing Classes
<p>
The Class Browser additionally allows adding methods and attributes directly by dialogs. This means you don't have to type the
classdeclaration and the implementation header yourself. After adding a method, you only have to set the formal parameters to the
implementation header and, if the method requrires an attribute, to the declaration.

<bf>&raquo How to add a method to a class</bf>

<enum>
<item>select the class you want to add a method
<item>press the right mouse button; the popup menu appears
<item>select "Add member function".
<item>the "Add member function" dialog appears.
<item>insert the type, declaration and documentation for the method
<item>specify the access and the modifiers for the method
<item>press OK to exit the dialog
</enum>

For adding a variable, this is the same action, just with selecting "Add member variable" in the popup menu.

The difference between the actions of these dialogs is that the adding of a variable will add the variable to the classdeclaration,
the adding of a method will add the method's declaration and the method's implementation header to the sources. As the classviewer
directly updates himself, you have a direct access to the new method implementation, so you only have to fill out the code for the
actual purpose of the method.

<sect>The Dialog Editor<label id="The Dialog Editor">
<p>
The KDevelop integrated Dialog Editor allows the easy construction of widgets and dialogs your application uses all by graphical means.
You see the direct appearance of your dialog as it will be presented to the user. Using the dialogeditor is usually the first step you
would take after creating a new project with the KAppWizard to create your main view, the user interaction dialogs and, after finishing
the graphical work, the code generation. This way, your project will contain all the usually considered "difficult" parts that normally
would take a long time to implement. Then, the "rest" of your work is implementing the functionality in the generated code. This
chapter deals with how to use the dialogeditor to create your project widgets as well as what to do in case you see your widgets need
corrections or additions during the further development process.

You can switch to the Dialog Editor either by selecting "Dialog Editor" from the "Tools"-menu or by the according toolbar icon.
To switch back to the Project Editor, select "KDevelop" from the dialogeditor's "Tools"-menu or by the icon in the toolbar.

What else does the dialogeditor's interface offer you ?  Mainly, that its appearance is almost the same as the project editor in term
of the main view separation as well as the menu- and toolbars. This allows you to make yourself accustomed with the dialogeditor very
quickly and, as he completely interacts with the project management, stay in the dialogeditor if you want to control your
build-process. Actions that require to switch back to KDevelop will do that automatically for you, like accessing the documentation
browser. Just select the menu commands, and KDevelop reacts to your will.

The following chapters give you an overview of the dialogeditor interface, how to create a new dialog initially and how set up the
properties of the child widgets that your dialog contains.

<sect1>The Dialog Editor View
<p>
<sect2>The Mainview
<p>
The dialogeditor's view is logically seperated by:
<itemize>
<item>The Widgets Tabulator, containing the "Widgets", "Dialogs" and "Items" tabs. These are described in <ref id="Adding Widgets"
name="Adding Widgets">.
<item>The Widget-Editor, representing the editing view for creating your dialog. See <ref id="The Widget Editor" name="The Widget
Editor">
<item>The Properties window, containing a list of properties and their values, dependend on the currently selected widget in the widget
editor. See <ref id="Setting Properties" name="Setting Properties"> for information how to specialize the widget's behavoir and look.
</itemize>

<sect2>Menubar, Toolbar and Statusbar differences to KDevelop
<p>
In Dialogeditor mode, KDevelop changes the menubar, toolbar and statusbar slighly to provide the functionality you need for creating
widgets. These are:

<sect3>Menubar
<p>
<bf/"File"-menu:/ replaces "New" with "New Dialog". "Open" allows to open a dialog definition file.

<bf/"View"-menu:/ replaces "Tree-View" with "Widgets-View", en/disableing the Widgets-View tabulators; adds "Properties-View" to
en/disable the Properties-View and "Grid Size" to let you specify the grid size in pixels for horizontal and vertical values.

<bf/"Build"-menu:/ replaces "Compile File" with "Generate Sources". This lets you actually generate the sources for your dialog.

<sect3>Toolbar
<p>
The toolbar contains a new icon for "New Dialog" as well as a replacement for "Compile File" by "Generate Sources".

<sect3>Statusbar
<p>
The statusbar is providing you information about the currently selected widget, especially displaying the values for X
and Y size in the coordinate system. For Statusbar help, you are provided the same functionality than in Project-editing mode.

While changing widget size, the statusbar shows the current values for width and height of the selecte widget.

<sect1>Creating a New Dialog
<p>
After creating your project skelleton, you are provided a ready-to-run application, according to your preferences. As KDevelop provides
the project types KDE and Qt application, the dialogeditor recognizes this and offers widget construction by the widgets that are
provided by the used libraries. To save time, you already should have a design in mind that will do the intended actions. For
information about widget design, see <em/The KDevelop Programming Handbook/.

To create a new dialog, select "New" from the "File"-menu or select "New" from the context menu in the "Dialogs" tab. The "New Dialog"
menu appears where you have to give KDevelop the dialog-specific information about the baseclass and the source file names and
destination.

<sect2>Dialog Class
<p>
The dialog class you can select, is the class that is inherited by your new widget, which is technically represented by a class itself.
Therefore, you have the following options:
<enum>
<item><bf/QWidget:/ the base class for all user interaction widgets provided by Qt. Used for main views and top-level widgets.
<item><bf/QFrame:/ inherits QWidget and is used by numerous widgets as a base class. This is useful for widgets that already want to
have a QFrame functionality in addition to QWidget methods.
<item><bf/Custom:/ inherits a custom class that has to be set in the "Custom Properties". This could be an already designed class
provided by your project or the libraries.
<item><bf/QDialog:/ the base class for dialogs that you would inherit for user interaction like setting properties or changing values.
<item><bf/QTabDialog:/ inherits QDialog and provides a dialog with predefined buttons and a set of tabs, which you will provide by the
widgets that you create.
</enum>

<bf/Custom Properties/

For the inheritance of a custom class as selected in the dialog class field, you have to specify the classname, which goes to "Custom
Class". The dialogeditor uses this for the code-generation; therefore, you also have to insert the "Custom Header", where the header
filename of the custom class has to be set.

<sect2>Files
<p>
In the "Files" section, you have to enter the widget's specific information. This is the classname (which would be e.g. KColorSelectDlg
for a dialog that allows selecting the color of a pen), the header, C++ and Data filenames.
When inserting the Classname, the filenames are given by the dialogeditor, but you can as well change the filenames.

Now, what about the files ? When you are ready with constructing the widget visually, you will have to generate the files that contain
the implementation for your widget. As this will be a class, the dialog will exist by the header file containing the classdeclaration,
a C++ file containing the method implementation for your widget's methods and slots. The Data file is the file that will contain a
function that is called by the constructor of your widget, the <em/initDialog()/ method. The file itself shouldn't be changed as it
will contain the generated code from the dialogeditor to create the widget on the screen. If you ever have to chage values, you should
do this by the constructor or be sure that you won't change the dialog during the development process, as the Data file wil be
overwritten each time the code is generated for your widget. The header and C++ file contain sections, where the dialogeditor writes;
these are marked by comments. After file generation, you can change any values and settings outside these sections; otherwise your
changees will get lost by the next code-creation.

<sect2>Location
<p>
For generating the widget's sources, the dialogeditor needs to know the location where these will go. The default value for the output
directory is the current project subdirectory containing the sources already present.

After pressing "OK", your default values are generated and an empty Widget constructor is opened. Then you are ready to go for creating
your own widget. Mind that the dialogeditor currently only supports static widgets without geometry management. If you're about to use
geometry management for your widgets, you should make yourself accustomed with the classes that Qt provides for this, create a new
class with the classgenerator and write your widget by hand. For more information, see <em/The KDevelop Programming Handbook/.


<sect1>Adding Widgets<label id="Adding Widgets">
<p>
After specifying the dialogs or widgets class and filenames, you are ready to start creating the widget and filling it with contents.
Adding low-level widgets to your dialog is a very easy task. Just select the widget you want to add from the "Wigets" tabulator on the
left; if it is not visible, select "Widgets-View" from the "View"-menu.

<sect2>The Widgets Tabulator
<p>
The widgets tab represents the available widgets you can place on the dialog. If you want information about a certain widget, press the
right mouse button over a widget icon and select "Quick-Help" from the popup-menu. Mind that the dialogeditor automatically determines,
if your project type is Qt-only or KDE. This prevents you from using KDE-widgets in a Qt application.

Currently provided widgets are:

<bf/QT-Widgets:/
<itemize>
<item><bf/QWidget/ - a widget that can be specified by yourself and can contain other widgets as well. This allows creating a widget
hirarchy within your dialog.
<item><bf/QLabel/ - a label that represents text information on the widget. Use QLabel e.g. in front of lineedits to signal what the
purpose of the lineedit is or which varialbe e.g. a combo box allows to set.
<item><bf/QPushButton/ - a button that allows to e.g. call another dialog like QFileDialog for selecting a filename.
<item><bf/QCheckBox/ - a checkbox for e.g. enableing/disableing options. QCheckBox is widely used for configuration dialogs.
<item><bf/QLCDNumber/ - displays numbers in LCD style. Often used for clocks.
<item><bf/QRadioButton/ - like QCheckBox often used to let the user set any options. QRadioButton specializes the options setting when more
of them depend on each other, e.g. you have three radiobuttons, but ony want the user to choose one of three offered options.
<item><bf/QComboBox/ - a combo box lets the user set a value by selecting it from a drop-down menu or by inserting the value, if the
box is write enabled.
<item><bf/QListBox/ - provides a single-column list of items that can be scrolled.
<item><bf/QMultiLineEdit/ - offers a multi-line editor.
<item><bf/QProgressBar/ - displays the progress of an action that takes a longer time to be finished.
<item><bf/QSpinBox/ - allows choosing numeric values by up- and down buttons or insertion if write enabled.
<item><bf/QSlider/ - sets a value in a program-defined range by a slider.
<item><bf/QScrollBar/ - indicates the range of a value and sets the current value by a slider as well as up- and down buttons; often
used for widgets whose contents is larger than the acutally visible view area. By using the scrollbar, the visible area can be changed
to another part of the widgets' contents.
<item><bf/QGroupBox/ - provides a groupbox frame with title to indicate that child widgets within the box belong together.
<item>More to come...
</itemize>

<bf/KDE-Widgets:/
<itemize>
<item>More to come...
</itemize>

After you selected a widget item, it is placed with default sizes and values on the editing window and marked selected by a frame and
darkened corners. To resize a widget, move your mouse over one of the dark spots and your cursor will change to display which resizing
directions are possible. Then press the mousebutton and move the mouse while hoding it. When you're finished with resizing the widget,
release the mouse. While resizing, the statusbar displays the current position of the item by X and Y values and the current size by
W(Width) and H(Height) values.

<sect2>The Dialogs Tabulator
<p>
The dialogs tabulator is intended to let you open your project's dialogs by a mouseclick. As the dialog's structure is saved in a
*.kdevdlg file within the directory that contains the generated files, only those dialog definition files are shown. Also mind that you
don't delete these definition files.

On selecting a dialog, it will be shown as by the state it was saved in the last editing step in the Widget-Editor view.

<sect2>The Items Tabulator
<p>
The Items tabulator lets you have an overview over the currently present widget items of the dialog hirarchically. This means, that, as
your background represents the parent of all widgets within the dialog, it is shown on top of the tree. The children of the main dialog
are then listed in the next tree-level.

On selecting an item, it gets marked in the edior view, as well as the properties are shown in the properties window.
Using the items view is sometimes important if your widgets behavoir depends on the parent-child relationship. For more information
see <em/The KDevelop Programming Handbook/.

<sect1>The Widget Editor<label id="The Widget Editor">
<p>
The Widget Editor is the main view that is placed in the middle and where you are constructing your widget. After adding items, those
can be selected and resized, as well as moved to the place you need them. Over all items, popup menus provide a quick access to
functions like cut, copy and insert.

<sect1>Setting Properties<label id="Setting Properties">
<p>
The properties window on the right is the place where you set the default behavoir for the widget and its items. It displays the
pre-set values for each selected item right away; changing values will result in direct changes on the Widget Editor view, e.g. naming
labels or buttons.

To separate certain property values by their effect, the properties window contains four folders; selecting a folder will pop up all
values for the properties group. All possible values are described below. Mind that the properties are dependend on the widget, e.g. a
label and button will have a property for their on-screen name, while lineedits will have properties for methods like <em/setText()/.

For a complete list of the available values per item, you should see the classreference of the widget which explains the used methods
and all possible values. Note that most values are implemented in QWidget and are used for all widgets that inherit QWidget. Also mind
that the final code does not contain any method calls that are unchanged by the user and therefore use the default values as given in
the widget's constructors.

<sect1>Properties of Qt supported Widgets
<p>
The following chapter gives a complete overview over the currently supported widgets of the Qt toolkit. To achieve a better
understanding of the properties, these are separated to their inheritance. As all of them inherit <tt/QWidget/, this class is described
first. All QWidget properties are available for all other widgets as well, so these are not listed for them again. For widget groups
that inherit an abstract subclass of QWidget as their baseclass, the baseclasses' properties are listed first (though this class does
not provide a widget in the dialogeditor itself). Then the widget properities for the available widget of the group contains the
properties that are specific to it. For a better understanding the inheritance tree of the available widgets is listed below:

<itemize>
<item><ref id="QWidget" name="QWidget">
	<itemize>
		<item><ref id="QButton" name="QButton"> (abstract)
			<itemize>
			<item><ref id="QCheckBox" name="QCheckBox">

	</itemize>
</itemize>

<sect2>QWidget Properties <label id="QWidget">
<p>
QWidget is the base class for almost all widgets in Qt and KDE. Therefore widgets that inherit QWidget will allow to use the same
settings in most cases.

<itemize>

<item><bf/Appearance:/

<itemize>
<item><bf/BgColor:/ Background color of the widget
<item><bf/BgMode:/ Background mode of the widget
<item><bf/BgPalColor:/ Color pallette for the background
<item><bf/BgPixmap:/ filename for a background pixmap
<item><bf/Cursor:/ Cusor over the widget
<item><bf/Font:/ Font for the widget

<sect1>Generating Files
<p>
After creating a widget, you have to generate the sourcecode to make it available in your project. This can be done either with the
"Generate Sources" from the "Build"-menu or by the according icon in the dialogeditor toolbar. Your Makefiles will be updated
automatically to include the new widget in the compiling process; therefore, after calling "Generate Sources", you can build your
project again within the dialogeditor. The output window pops up below the Widget-Editor window as in Project Editor mode.

Now that your project contains a new widget, your work as a programmer is to implement functionality to the used slots and eventually
add other methods you may need.

For more information about implementation of the widgets functions, see <em/The KDevelop Programming Handbook/.

<sect>General Configuration<label id="General Configuration">
<p>
This chapter describes how you can set your individual preferences about how KDevelop works. All settings adressed below can be
found by the according entry in the Options-menu.
<sect1>Configuring the "Tools" Menu<label id="Configuring the &dquot;Tools&dquot; Menu">
<p>
As KDevelop supports the use of third-party programs within it's user interface, you are able to configure any program that suits
your needs towards application development. This can be done by adding programs to the already pre-defined ones in the
"Tools"-menu. To change the tools-menu, select "Tools" from the "Options" menu. This dialog allows to specify the entry name,
program and additional command line options you want to pass to the execution. To remove a program from the menu, select the entry
name and choose "Delete". To add a program, specify the menuentry, where a & is used as a menu-accelerator; you may compare the
already configured entries with the entry list. Select the binary and pass your commandline options. Then hit "Add" and the entry
is added to the list. After leaving the configuration dialog, the tools-menu updates itself, so the new configuration is already
usable without restarting KDevelop.
<sect1>KDevelop Setup<label id="KDevelop Setup">
<p>
<bf>Make-command:</bf>
The General Options dialog lets you configure KDevelop's general settings.
First, you should set the make-command available on your system. If the selected program does not exist,
KDevelop will warn you the next time your're invoking a make command.

<bf>Autosave:</bf>

If Autosave is checked, KDevelop will save all changed files periodically.  The autosaving time range can be set to 3, 5, 15 or 30 minutes.


<bf>Autoswitch:</bf>

If Autoswitch is enabled, the KDevelop windows will switch on and off according to the usage context, e.g.  if you switch to a
documentation in the Helpmenu, the Documentation browser will be opened, together with the documentation tree and the output
window turned off.
Startup:

For starting KDevelop, you have the option to enable/disable the startlogo to be shown during the time KDevelop loads.
Further, if you don't like the last project to be opened on startup, you can disable the default behavoir.
<sect1>Changing Keyboard Shortcuts<label id="Changing Keyboard Shortcuts">
<p>
The Configure Keys dialog lets you configure the KDevelop key bindings. Note that global keys can be configured in the
KDE Control Center, such as open file and print.  A key function can be configured by choosing the menu entry. Then the
configuration can be changed by checking values like the Alt / Ctrl key etc.

<sect1>Documentation<label id="Documentation">
<p>
<sect2> Directories
<p>
For setting up the documentation browser to work correctly, KDevelop needs some information about where the HTML- documentation
is placed on the system. Therefore, the Documentation Path properties dialog needs the path of the Qt- online documentation in HTML
as well as the path to the KDE-library documentation.

Usually, the Qt-documentation is placed in the same directory where Qt is installed; e.g. if Qt resides in /usr/local/qt, the path
you have to enter is /usr/local/qt/html. For the KDE- Documentation, you have to set the directory to the root of the
documentation, assumed all KDE-Libs documentation resides in the same directory. Both path's can be selected by pressing the
according buttons, displaying a path-selection. If your system doesn't contain the documentation for the KDE-libs,  you should
first enter the next configuration dialog, Update KDE-Documentation. This will create the documentation to a path of your choice,
also setting the KDE Library Doc path automatically.

<sect2>Options
<p>
<sect3>Update KDE-Documentation
<p>
For those users who don't have a recent documentation of the KDE-libraries, especially the documentation for the files
installed on the system, the Update KDE-Documentation dialog creates a new one or updates existing documentations. This
function requires your system to have kdoc and qt2kdoc installed, included in the kdesdk package. First of, you have to set
up the path to your recent kdelibs sources, which is not the include-path for KDE ! Just enter the path to the sources, like:
/home/rnolden/kdelibs-1.1/.

Then, you can choose three different installation modes, as:

<itemize>
<item> Delete old Documentation and  install to recent Documentationpath:  this assumes that youalready have a documentation
installed and is placed in the path the Documentation Path-dialog was entered. This will delete all documentation and install the
newly generated documentation into the recent path.
<item> Delete old Documentation and install to new Documentationpath:   this will result in deleting the old documentation as
well as above, but gives you the choice to set up a new documentation place.
<item> Leave old Documentation untouched and install to new Documentation path:   This is recommended for a new generation of
the kdelibs documentation for users who didn't have one before and for those who want to keep the last documentation for an older
kdelibs version.
</itemize>

The "new KDE Libs Documentation path" is to be set  for option 2 and 3 of the installation mode.  This is also recommended for
users who generate a new documentation from scratch.

After pressing the OK button, KDevelop will create a subdirectory "kdoc-reference" in the documentation path containing the kdoc
reference files.  First, the qt library documentation classes will be indexed to connect the Qt documentation with the
documentation to be generated for the kdelibs.  So it is important that you have set up the Qt documentation path first to ensure
that it can be found by qt2kdoc. Finally, the KDE libs will be indexed and the documentation will be build with crossreferences to
give browsing the most functionality.

<sect3>Create Search Database
<p>
The Create Search Database dialog, accessed via the create-button, allows the programmer to create a database to search for a
keyword interactively.  To create and use the documentation search function, you must have the program glimpse 4.1 installed.
Preset are the options to index the given KDE-library documentation as well as the Qt-documentation, assuming the path to the
documentation files were set in the "Documentation Path" dialog of the options- menu.   Additionally, the index can include
directories the user can set up himself by the "additional directories to index"-field.  After setting a path to an addional
directory, the "Add" - button must be pushed to set the path.  A path once set can be removed from the index by selecting the path
in the path field and pushing "Remove". Furthermore, the user is offered three different modes for the index size: tiny, small and
medium.  The higher the index size, the more the index files will grow. On the other hand, a search in a bigger searchdatabase
will be faster and more successful, so we suggest choosing a "medium" size. For using the search function, see section
<ref id="Using the Documentation Browser" name="Using the Documentation Browser">.

<sect>Questions and Answers<label id="Questions and Answers">
<p>
This section adresses questions by users that were answered by the KDevelop Team or by their supporters on the KDevelop
mailinglist during experiences with the current versions of KDevelop as well as bug reporting in general.

<sect1>Bug Reporting <label id="Bug Reporting">
<p>
Another improvement of KDevelop is the integrated bug-reporting system via email. If you experience a bug, you have the option to send
the KDevelop development team a bug report either by your email-client or by the bug-report dialog. All bug-reports are collected on
the KDevelop website and can be reviewed on <htmlurl url="http://fara3.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/bugarchive/maillist.html"
name="fara3.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/bugarchive/maillist.html">. You can also receive all bug-reports via subscription to the
bug-report mailinglist by sending an empty email to <htmlurl  url="mailto:kdevelop-bug-report-request@fara3.cs.uni-potsdam.de"
name="kdevelop-bug-report-request@fara3.cs.uni-potsdam.de"> with "subscribe <em/your_email_adress/" as the body contents.

To send bug reports, please use this email adress by your mail program. If you want to use KDevelop for direct bug-reporting, choose
"Bug Report" from the "Help" menu. You are presented the report dialog that lets you enter all necessary information about the bug you
found. After pressing "OK", the dialog's contents is sent to the mailinglist automatically.

<sect1>Where to get Information
<p>
<bf>Q:</bf> I have a question which is not adressed in the FAQ file, nor in the manuals of KDevelop. Where should I turn to ?

<bf>A:</bf>  In any case send all requests that are regarding KDevelop by subscribing to the KDevelop mailinglist at <htmlurl
url="mailto:kdevelop@fara3.cs.uni-potsdam.de" name = "kdevelop@fara3.cs.uni-potsdam.de">. Send a mail with an empty header and
"subscribe" as contents; then you can participate on the discussions. All questions should go there and will be adressed there as well.
If you stick to that, you will get the most help by the developers and all users having the same problems, as well as helping to keep
the FAQ up to date.

The KDevelop Homepage at <htmlurl url="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html"
name="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html"> also contains a mailing-list archive that allows you to browse the
mails already send by the subscribers, so you should look there first as most problems should have been adressed already by the team or
other users.

<sect1>Library and System Problems
<p>

<bf>Q:</bf> Wrong JPEG library version: library is 61, caller expects 62

<bf>A:</bf>  There are 2 ways.
<enum>
<item> When the kdelibs are installed it installs header files for the
 jpeg libraries, these are version 61,  however most distributions
 (Redhat) use version 62 libraries. To fix  this just remove jpeglib.h
 from /opt/kde/include. The pukka include  file for version 62 should
 then be picked up. However looking at the  error message above it may
 be the other way round, in any case ensure  you only have on version
 of the header file, the library and that  they are consistent.

 It is useful to use the locate command to verify that I have
 the correct version of a library and header files e.g.
 updatedb
 locate libjpeg
 locate jpeglib

<item> You must recompiled kdesupport without jpeg
 library (./configure --with-libjpeg --with-libgif).
</enum>


<bf>Q:</bf>
 <tscreen><verb>
make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/local/src/kdevelop-0.3/po'
cd .. && automake --gnu --include-deps po/Makefile
aclocal.m4: 2709: `AM_PROG_INSTALL' is obsolete; use `AC_PROG_INSTALL'
make[2]: *** [Makefile.in] Error 1
</verb></tscreen>
<bf>A:</bf>  Workaround for automake-1.4/automake-2.13 users: Just run
 "aclocal" manually, then it will compile.


<bf>Q:</bf>  What must i do, if configure said ,that i need giflib23.

<bf>A:</bf>  Try a newer snap of kdesupport, or maybe you have another giflib installed?


<bf>Q:</bf> How can I convert a KDevelop 0.2 project to a 0.3 one?

<bf>A:</bf> Please change the AC_OUTPUT in the configure.in to a oneline version

 for example:
 old version:
<tscreen><verb>
AC_OUTPUT(Makefile \
kdevelop/kwrite/Makefile \
kdevelop/templates/Makefile
)
</verb></tscreen>
 new version:
<tscreen><verb>
AC_OUTPUT(Makefile kdevelop/kwrite/Makefile kdevelop/templates/Makefile)
</verb></tscreen>


<bf>Q:</bf>  I  get the following linker errors when using SuSE Linux with KDE 1.1, what do I have to do to get KDevelop linked ?
<tscreen><verb>

<bf>A:</bf> If you have the SuSE rpms of KDE-1.1, you must recompile the kdelibs without the patch commited by SuSE and reinstall
them or get an updated rpm of the kdelibs from <htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.suse.com" name="ftp://ftp.suse.com">

<sect1>Usage Questions
<p>
<bf>Q:</bf> I see the KDevelop does not allow for usage of the delete key (or backspace deleting when text is marked).

<bf>A:</bf>  go to "Options"->"Editor" and make sure that "Delete on Input" is enabled, then backspace and delete works.


<bf>Q:</bf> If I add files to my project, will they be automatically included and compiled ?

<bf>A:</bf> Yes, they are included in the Makefile.am's then and if you make a "Rebuild All" (./configure updates the Makefiles), your new
added files will be included as well.

<bf>Q:</bf> If I removed a file, I get some weird linker messages. What is wrong with my project ?

<bf>A:</bf> If the removed file is a header file, that is automatically processed by automoc (running the Qt-Meta-Object-Compiler
automatically on all headers), your removed header is still present as a moc-generated *.moc.cpp file and compiled.  Remove the
according *.moc.cpp file and rebuild the project.

<sect>Thanks
<p>
We like to express special thanks to all of our family members and friends who supported us in several ways to let us construct
and improve KDevelop.

Further, we thank  Jochen Wilhelmy  for offering his program kwrite and his help on integrating it into KDevelop.

Thanks also to the KDE team and Stephan Kulow, who gave us the possibility to work on KDevelop via CVS

We hope that our free work on this product will lead to a better acceptance of Free Software and its development. Without the help
and idealism of many, the KDevelop IDE would never have been realized in such a short period of time and we're proud that so many
users already have reported good experience and brought KDevelop to it's destiny: helping free software programmers to build a
better world where users have the freedom of choice.
