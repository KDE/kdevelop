    * File bug to lldb-mi for other missing commands

- Fix TODOs in files

- Change test_gdb to avoid direct use of QTest::qWait, which starts event loop, and could cause session to
  be deleted. Use WAIT_FOR_STATE_AND_IDLE(session, <previous state>) instead. Or use QPointer for session.

- Known issues
    * Debugger console
        + debugger CLI stdout isn't shown, due to bug https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=28026
    * Remote debugging
        + When using 'lldb-server gdbserver' as remote server, server exits once debug session ended.
        + When using 'gdbserver' as remote server
            - Remote work path can't contain space
            - Can't actually start inferior
    * Breakpoints
        + Pending breakpoints doesn't work, which also causes break on start not function
            - Can still manually set pending breakpoints
        + Breakpoint hit count is not updated timely (limitation in lldb-mi)
        + No watchpoint support
            - Can still manually add watch point
    * Threads
        + lldb-mi crashes when break on a point where multiple threads running. (Fixed in latest lldb trunk version)
    * Attach to process
        + works internally, but there's no way to access it in the UI currently.
