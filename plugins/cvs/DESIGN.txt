CVS plugin for KDevelop4
========================
(C) Robert Gruber [rgruber A users!sourceforge!net]


The CVS plugin is separated into three part.

1) The CvsPart (cvspart.h)
   It is the main entry point to the CVS plugin. By implementing 
   the IVersionControl interface it offers a lot of slots that will
   invoke the different CVS actions.
   This class serves as a dispatcher. It takes the urls and options 
   for the requested CVS action and passes them to the CvsProxy (#2)
   to get a CvsJob returned. After starting, the job's result() signal
   gets connected either directly to CvsMainView (#3) or to a custom
   output view.

2) CvsProxy (cvsproxy.h) and CvsJob (cvsjob.h)
   The CvsProxy serves as a single point of entry for creating the
   CvsJobs. The proxy offers a list of methods for the different
   supported CVS actions. Each of these methods will return a CvsJob
   object. So the caller does not have to worry about the whole 
   job and commandline creation. Calling the appropriate method will
   do all the work and return a CvsJob object ready for starting.

3) The CvsMainView (cvsmainview.h) and custom view (like editorsview.h)
   The CvsMainView displays output from finished jobs. It holds a 
   KTabWidget to which everbody can add custom output views. For
   instance when the user requested a "cvs log" action, a new view
   will be added. This view will then parse the output of the "cvs log"
   job and display it in a nice way.
   But it does not make sense to add new views for every cvs action.
   For example, adding a new view everytime "cvs commit", "cvs edit" or
   similar actions get executed would be an overkill. Therefore 
   CvsMainView also provides a generic output view that just displays 
   the plain text output from such jobs. Unlike custom views, this 
   generic view can not be closed and it will simply append the output 
   from each job that got connected to it.



The workflow of the CVS plugin looks like this:
1) The user requests a CVS action
2) The matching slot from CvsPart will be called
3) Optional: The user may be prompted for additional input
   [ see: CvsPart::commit() ]
4) CvsPart passes all needed options to the CvsProxy by calling
   it's method for the requested action.
5) CvsProxy assembles the commandline, creates a CvsJob object and
   returns a pointer to the CvsJobs object
6) CvsPart calls start() for the returned CvsJob object and continues
   with either #6.1 or #6.2
6.1) Connectes the job's result() signal to the generic output view 
     from CvsMainView
6.2) Creates a custom view, connects the job's result() signal to it
     and adds the view to CvsMainView
