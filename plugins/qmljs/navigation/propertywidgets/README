This folder contians the implementations for the "edit a property with a slider-style" widgets
which show up when you move the cursor over certain properties in a QML document.
When creating a new widget, you MUST:
    * create a new QML file in this folder, named like whatever you want
    * add that file with the property name you want to support to propertypreviewwidget.cpp::constructIfPossible
      (it's okay to redirect multiple properties to the same file)
    * implement the widget in QML, where you MUST
         - add a "property string value" property to your root widget, which will
           be set to the value the widget should start with during initialization
           (but after the component completes loading, so you have to listen for changes on it)
         - add a signal with signature "signal valueChanged(string newValue)" to your root widget
         - specify a width and height for your root widget, in pixels.
You usually do the following in your widget then:
    * If it's a slider based widget, just copy one of the examples, e.g. Distance.qml and edit it.
      For sliders, you MUST have two functions
            function sliderToValue(slider) {
                return slider;
            }
            function valueToSlider(value) {
                return value;
            }
      defined in your root widget, which convert the slider value (0-96) to the value you want in the text document
      and vice versa (so sliderToValue ° valueToSlider must be identity if you don't want your slider to jump)
      If the widget is slider based, the valueChanged signal you defined will be emitted automatically by the Slider class.
    * Otherwise, do whatever you like, just call valueChanged(text) when you want to update the text in the document.
      The text will be set directly to whatever you pass to that signal, without any checks done.

Widgets only displaying stuff are fine too, see e.g. FontFamily.qml.
Such a "read-only" widget must still have a value property and a valueChanged signal defined!

Altough it might seem obvious, you do not have to restart KDevelop to test these widgets, just running "make install"
and re-opening the widget is enough. You can even specify the path to your kdev-qml/navigation/propertywidgets folder
in the propertypreviewwidget class temporarily (instead of the one determined by kstandarddirs), then you can
test without re-running installation.
