2005-01-22 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
 * Global scope plugins are once again optional.
 * Fixed source navigation history (by reducing the ambition to something that can work).

2005-01-20 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
 * Further cleanup of plugin handling in PluginController/ProjectManager.
 * Removed the last traces of in-project language switching. 
 
2005-01-09 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
 * Finished the new CTags frontend.

2005-01-08 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
 * Made it possible to finally remove Code Completion databases via the GUI
 * Cleaned up the context menu mess (at least it's optional now, and the code 
 is cleaner).

2005-01-03 Robert Gruber <rgruber@users.sourceforge.net>
 * Added support for CVS commands edit, unedit and editors

2004-12-19 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
 * Made it possible to add custom build commands (like make install-exec)
   for the subproject context menu in automake manager.
 
2004-12-17 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
 * Advanced subclassing option in C++ New Class Wizard can be used
   for classes in the persistant class store. This means that if
   the PCS for Qt library is built then advanced subclassing from
   Qt classes is possible in the wizard.

2004-12-15 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
 * Finished the implementation of plugin profiles for KDevelop shell
   and shell extension architecture.
   This means that KDevelop IDE becomes a KDevelop Platform now. And
   KDevelop IDE is now only a program built on KDevelop Platform.
 * Made KDevelop Assistant to use KDevelop Platfrom.
 * Implemented profile detection for projects. Now, for example, when you open
   C++ language project KDevelop loads "CppIDE" profile. If a project file
   has KDE keyword set then KDevelop loads "KDECppIDE" profile (profile defines
   a list of plugins to be loaded and unloaded). kdevprofileeditor will show
   all information related to the profile.

2004-11-23  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added some ruby project options which are used for both debugging and an
   ordinary run.
     - Main program (this is in addition to the automake project main program)
     - Program arguments
     - Run main program or run selected window options
 * The '-K' character coding project option is now passed to the debugger too

2004-11-22 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
 * Implemented simple VCS integrators for Clearcase, Perforce and Subversion.
 * Reenabled subversion support plugin.
 * Imported svn kioslave from kdesdk HEAD into a compat library therefore svn 
   will work on KDE<3.3.90 too.

2004-11-21 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
 * Added KDevVCSIntegrator extra interface. VCS Integrator is a plugin which is used by
   application wizard to select a version control and possibly import newly created project
   into the VCS.
 * Implemented VCS integrator for CVS (Cervisia).
 * Patched ProjectManager to load selected VCS plugin.

2004-11-20  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Ruby Source Code Debugger initial checkin
 * Based on John Birch's gdb front end, the UI is very similar. There are no
   assembly language step options or disassembly viewers, but pretty much
   everything else is much the same in ruby as for gdb/C++.
 * You can set breakpoints on file/line or file/method, watchpoints to break when
   a ruby expression is valid and catchpoints to break when an exception is thrown.
 * The Watch variable viewer allows ruby expressions to be watched, and they are
   updated on program pause.
 * A configuration option was added to enable/disable the debugger floating toolbar.
 * The debugger backend is written in pure ruby using the code from the 'debug.rb',
   source included with the ruby distribution. It is started via KProcess which handles
   redirection of stdout and stderr. The idea came from the way Laurent Julliard 
   implemented the FreeRIDE ruby debugger - it uses Distributed Ruby (like DCOP) 
   for messaging. DRuby is ruby-specific and couldn't be used though.
 * The debugger communicates with the backend via a Unix domain socket;
   commands are sent, and the replies are parsed in KDevelop in much the same way
   as the gdb debugger uses stdin and stdout to send and receive.

2004-11-17 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
 * KDevelop interfaces cleanup and enchancements. Interfaces are now smaller, additional, not so important
   interfaces are available through extension mechanism (see KDevPlugin::extension() methods).
   Also added a lot of API documentation.
   
2004-10-30 Robert Gruber <rgruber@users.sourceforge.net>
 * Implemented "grouping of snippets" feature for SnippetPart

2004-10-30  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Fixed ruby class and instance variable type matching bugs
 * Added error message if the ruby code to run can't be located by the top level C++ stub
 * The default character coding for KDE ruby projects is UTF-8
 * If a class is declared several times in a file, the line number of the first instance
   is used in the class browser, and not the last one.

2004-10-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added the 'qmakeapp' project template translated to QtRuby

2004-10-28  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Fixed Ruby KDE app and DCOP service templates so they work again.
 * Implemented a 'Character Coding' ruby project option

2004-10-27  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Implemented ruby class '@@' and '@' instance variables in the class browser. 

 * Ruby doesn't have declarations for class or instance variables, and so a variable is 'declared'
   when it is first  assigned to. So the first assignment encountered in the ruby source is used, 
   unless the variable is set in the iniitaiize() method when that is considered as the 'first'.

 * The type of the variable is inferred from the type of the thing on the rhs of the assignment to it.

2004-10-27  Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
 Exclude non API classes from the doxygen API documentation. 
 Please use the "doxygen doxyfile" command to test it. 

2004-10-27 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
    The first step in creating RubyQt/Korundum RAD environment -
    started to implement KDevDesigner integration for Ruby:
    works: automatic and manual subclass creation;
    doesn't work: function adding, editing and removing.

2004-10-25  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added a ruby DCOP service project template
 * Improved the kapp Korundum application framework. It configures, builds and installs
   a C++ top level stub, that starts the ruby app. The ruby scripts are located via the
   KStandardDirs/KInstance mechanism, in directory ..share/apps/<appname>
 * k_dcop and k_dcop_signals declarations are shown as slot and signal declarations in
   the class parser.
 * =begin to =end comments are ignored
 * Added icons for Ruby configure and run options. The Run button now starts the main program
   with the ruby '-C' option to switch to the main program's directory.
 * Added missing scope attribute to the class parser methods
 

2004-10-23  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Implemented ruby slots/signals declaration navigation in the class browser
 * Atrr accessor and access control method lists can span multiple lines

2004-10-23 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
    * KDevelop documentation viewer and KDevAssistant:
      - implemented font configuration options;
      - disabled loading of KHTML plugins.
      
2004-10-21 Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
    * KDevelop Platform:
      - implemented profiles library and editor engine;
      - implemented profiles editor (kdevprofileeditor application);
      - set up X-KDevelop-Property properties in .desktop files of KDevelop parts.

2004-10-21  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added a KDE Korundum Ruby application framework based on the languages/cpp/app_templates/kapp
   C++ project template
 * Improved the Ruby class parser
 * Both classes and modules are shown in the class browser
 * Class or 'singleton' methods supported and appear as 'static' methods
 * Access types of 'public', 'protected' and 'private' supported
 * attr_accessor, attr_reader and attr_writer method definitions supported. For attr_accessor or 
   attr_writer a 'foo=' method is shown.
 * Operator methods are shown in the class browser too

2004-10-13 Alexander Neundorf <neundorf@kde.org>
    *buildtools/custommakefiles/:
    -add two submenus "Object Files" and "Other Files" to the "Build Targets" menu
    -add new tag <filelistdirectory> so that the filelist file can be 
     located outside the source directory. This is currently only written
     by the cmake kdevelop3 project file generator

2004-08-27 Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
    * Updated support for Doxygen 1.3.8

2004-06-21 Robert Gruber <rgruber@users.sourceforge.net>
    * Added drag and drop support to SnippetPart
    * Added filter support to AppOutputView

2004-06-17 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Added optional automatic reload on external file modification. This is only available with katepart.
    * Added CopyTo plugin. A small utility to do network transparent file copying using KIO.
    * Disabled VCS repository creation in the appwizard (doesn't work and the implementation broke the 
      plugin handling) and import (to be reimplemented using KTrader).
    * Added the simple basics of Plugin Profiles. Will finish this the coming days.

2004-06-14 Alexander Dymo <adymo@mksat.net>
    * Documentation plugin can show methods in index for Qt and Doxygen documentation catalogs.
    * Implemented a dialog to run profiler (calltree + kcachegrind).

2004-06-05 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Fixed several ToolView related issues. Among other things, they should now 
      automatically restore their last position after a restart.

2004-05-31 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * KDevelop has made a large step towards being the RAD tool for KDE.
      Qt Designer is ported to KParts and KXMLGUI technology and can now
      be embedded into KDevelop and integrated with it. It consists of
      KDevDesignerPart and KDevDesigner shell program. Part is embeddable
      everywhere and shell can be launched as standalone designer (run kdevdesigner).
    * The first step to integration between KDevDesigner and KDevelop is done.
      CppSupport can now automatically create implementation files (subclasses) for forms
      and automatically add slot implementations.

2004-05-27 Sascha Cunz <scunz@ng-projekt.de>
    * Change "New File" in the toolbar to popup a menu with all available file templates,
      if one clicks on it.

    * Add possibility to define environment variables for the configure stage.

2004-05-08 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Devhelp and KDevelopTOC documentation plugins are implemented. Indexes that exist
      in devhelp and kdeveloptoc files are now taken into account.

2004-05-04 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Doxygen documentation plugin (toc and index) is implemented.
      This means that kdevassistant can browse KDE API docs and has table of contents and index!
      kdevassistant (and kdevelop itself) is now the first documentation browser where you can 
      look for Qt and KDE classes at the same time (using one index).

2004-04-30 Sascha Cunz <scunz@ng-projekt.de>
    * Added Paul Drummond's patch for having "favourites" in appwizard.

2004-04-25 Sascha Cunz <scunz@ng-projekt.de>
    * Added support for reading the licenses that appwizard uses dynamically. Install all current licenses
      to $prefix/share/apps/kdevelop/licenses

2004-04-22 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Added brand new "Look in documentation" function that puts the term under the cursor into the
      documentation index tab and looks up for this term in the index.
    * Added "Search in Documentation" and "Look in Documentation" menu items into the "Help" menu 
      with shortcuts <Ctrl+Alt+S> and <Ctrl+Alt+I> respectively.
    * Implemented "Goto manpage" and added "Goto infopage" function in the "Help" and editor context menus.

      to the title of an opened document.
    * Use also a default KDE shortcut for popup menu to open editor context menu.

2004-04-21 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Added Gtk-- application template by Andrew Patterson.

2004-04-20 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Wired up katepart's editor context menu - we now finally have copy/paste in the context menu.
    * Added a keyboard shortcut to open the editor context menu. (CTRL+Return)

2004-04-16 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Added MimeWarningDialog - KDevelop will now ask the user what to do when an unknown mimetype is encountered.

2004-04-15 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Added Thomas Nagy's KConfig XT based apptemplate.

2004-04-14 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Rewrote and documented the KDevPartController interface to reduce the duplication of a lot of common but 
      trivial code all over the codebase.
    * Moved the documentation history out of the PartController and into the docviewer part.
    * Moved source navigation history into the PartController and disabled the HistoryPart.

2004-04-14 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Here is my gift for all Qt Designer fans! A KDevelop Assistant program is now available (run kdevassistant
      from a command line). KDevelop Assistant is a lightweight version of KDevelop with only documentation
      and file selector parts enabled.

2004-04-12 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Full text search in new documentation part now functional. Search results are presented in html page
      and in listview as well.

2004-04-09 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Commited new documentation part for KDevelop. It features documentation plugin system,
      it's easy now to add support for a new documentation format by implementing DocumentationPlugin interface.
      Index is now loading faster, index caching mechanism is used. Configuration dialog became more clean and convenient.

2004-03-22 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Restructured CppSupportPart::parseProject()

2004-03-17 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Extended diffpart to also handle FileContext and dirty files.
    * Updated FileList. Now supports filestate feedback and has a context menu for file operations.
    * More cleanups in Core. Filestate is now emitted from PartController for the receivers to implement.

2004-03-15 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * NewMainWindow is now enabled by default
    * Added settings in "User Interface" for TabWidget visibility and IDEAl mode button layout

2004-02-24 Jens Dagerbo <jens.dagerbo@swipnet.se>
    * Added FileList plugin
    * Added CTags2 plugin

2004-02-23 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>

   * latest sync with KMdi of kdelibs-cvsHead (fixes some crashes)
   * enabled kmdiguiclient.h/cpp for KDE less version 3.2 too
   (-> this introduces KDE-accels Ctrl+Shift+Alt+L/R/B/T for IDEAl-docks and Ctrl+Alt+CursorLeft/CursorRight for cycling IDEAl-toolviews)
   * bugfix: proper names of View menu
   * now save the docking state to another section of kdeveloprc (to let people (who tried KMdi alpha versions) escape a vicious cycle)

2003-11-16 Mario Scalas <marioscalas@agilemovement.it>
    * Version control color feedback for the file view (currently implemented 
      by vcs/cvsservice plugin only).

2003-11-13 Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
    * Readded a even cleaner kdevelop.kdevelop file.
    PLEASE do _not_ commit changes to this file.
    We have until mid January 2004 to make the necessary code changes that create a more "cvs friendly" file by moving some of the options to the .kdevses file.
    For info on how to do it, read:
    http://developer.kde.org/documentation/library/cvs-api/kdevelop/html/howToAddPlugins.html
    I think this is very important fo the success of KDevelop3 in for developer teams (no man is an island!).
    Alexander and F@lk seam to agree with me on this one.

2003-11-09 F@lk Brettschneider <falkbr@kdevelop.org>
    * as planned and decided months ago, now I
      removed KDevelop's own special implementation of IDEAl UI mode.
      This has been replaced by KDE's IDEAl UI mode, globally implemented in kdelibs/kmdi.
      Now we increase maintainance, KDE-comformity and can switch all KDevelop UI modes on the fly.

2003-10-29 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Imported updated pascal parser, it isn't restricted now to pascal-78.
      Most object pascal/delphi extensions are supported.

2003-10-17 Dominik Haumann <dhdev@gmx.de>
    * new Application templates in cpp: kateplugin2, noatunvisual,
    noatunui, kbearimportfilter, kbearplugin, kfileplugin
    * fixed 53943, 64028
    * parts/appwizard: Now you can add "ShowFilesAfterGeneration=file1,file2"
    to the app_tamplate's information-file (example: khello/khello) so that
    file1 and file2 are shown after project generation - usually a README.devel
    and/or source code files the user has to modify.
    ShowFilesAfterGeneration= takes a comma separated list of files regarding to
    the project root directory wheras
      - APPNAMEUC will be replaced with the projectname.upper()
      - APPNAMELC will be replaced with the projectname.lower()
      - APPNAME   will be replaced with the projectname.
    Function 'openMainFile()'is now deprecated and therefore removed.
    * updated documentation for this stuff.
    * new in New-Project-Dialog: Getting the Project location with "..." asks
    if it should set tht directory to the DefaultProjectsDir.

2003-10-13 Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
    * Moved the language specific documentation to the languages/xxx/doc directories

2003-10-08 Tilman Vogel <Tilman Vogel web de (dot at dot)>
    - added auto completion to the namespace field
    - added classes from all namespaces to the auto completion of the base
      class field, add classes from specified namespace without qualifier
    - lookup classes for parsing in the correct namespace, not only the global namespace
    - fixed bug causing crash when changing inheritance mode

2003-10-04 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Reenabled Ada language support (ported it to code model and reenabled

2003-10-04 Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
    * On-line, automaticaly updated every 24H, KDevelop API Documentation can be viewed with the doctreeview.

2003-10-02 Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
    * Renamed KDevelop executable from gideon to kdevelop.
    * This makes KDevelop3 OVERWRITE KDevelop 2.x instalations.
    * Restructured the directories acording to the API documentation
       buildtools -> has the old Project managers
       languages -> language support (includes app_templates, file_templates, compilerplugin, pcsimporter and debugger)
       editors -> editors support
       vcs -> Version control systems (clearcase, cvs, perforce, svn, cvsservice and cervisia)

2003-09-26 Amilcar Lucas <amilcar@kdevelop.org>
    * Added per target run arguments to the automake manager.
      These arguments are used when no Main program (Project Options...-> Run Options) is selected and the Program arguments  (Project Options...-> Run Options) are left empty.

2003-09-22 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Finished GUI for enabling and disabling documentation topics in a project configuration
      dialog. Thanks to Amilcar Lucas for original idea and implementation.
    * Added popup menu for the documentation viewer. It contains "Open in New Window", "Reload",
      "Stop" and "Set Encoding" actions.
    * Created mimetypes directory in KDevelop source tree. Here we can put all mimetypes necessary
      for KDevelop that are not available in kdelibs.
    * Added x-fortran, x-pascal and chm (HTML Help) mime types.

2003-09-10 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Added the GUI to create custom code completion databases
      based on user selected directories.

    * Some updates on the "KDevelop 3.0 users's manual" (docbook)

2003-08-29 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
    * Added the initial version of generic project manager.
      It is the replacement of script/custom/pascal/ada/haskell/etc. project managers.
      Extensible with plugins. Currently available project manager based on shell scripts.

2003-08-28 Harald Fernengel <harry@kdevelop.org>
    * SQL support now displays tables and fields in the classbrowser

2003-08-27 Harald Fernengel <harry@kdevelop.org>
    * Added language support on the fly - you can switch to
      SQL mode from a CPP project, or to Perl if you have scripts

2003-08-26 Harald Fernengel <harry@kdevelop.org>
    * Added version information for plugins to prevent opening
      binary incompatible plugins from old versions.

2003-08-10 jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Roger Larsson's patch that adds remote debugging.

2003-08-03 jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * fixes for debugger startup problems
    * fixes for debugger shutdown
    A significant change in this patch is that we no longer attempt to
    shutdown gdb from information that gdb supplies. This must now be done by
    the user via the stop button.
    A reproductable crash after the client program segfaulted and the user
    tried to continue, shutdown and then restarted has been fixed.
    I suspect that this was the major cause of the reported crashes judging
    from the few backtraces supplied.

2003-07-28 Mario Scalas <mario.scalas@libero.it>
    * PartExplorer is now shown in the embedded SelectView because the dialog-based interface was hardly useful!

    * If no Main Program was selected in Project Options...-> Run Options, then use the
      currently selected active target. This is valid for execution and for debugging.
      So no more need to goto the menu every time you want to debug a new target! Just
      activate it and you're done! :)
      Currently only in Automake based project because AFAIK it the only one that has
      the concept of active targets. Correct me if I'm wrong.

2003-07-13 Andras Mantia <amantia@freemail.hu>
     * don't treat libtool link messages for modules as errors.

          (This is just an addition: old code should work as before).
        * (FileView) FileTreeWidget supports multiple files selections now. Removed
          drag support because it needs to be fixed by TT (seems a bug from qt-3.1.2

    * Added notification if a file has been modified outside the IDE
      (IDEAl mode only for now).

      assign your favourite keybinding to the commands.

2003-06-14 Hamish Rodda <rodda@kde.org>
    * Warn if another process is running on execution and allow a restart.
    * Make automake deal with METASOURCES=AUTO

2003-06-12 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>

2003-06-11 Hamish Rodda <rodda@kde.org>
    * Implemented "Debug in KDevelop" hook into drkonqi (the KDE crash
      handler). Press the button and kdevelop attaches to the process
      and brings up the frame stack, as long as the binary name of the
      process is the same as your binary.  Requires an update to
      kdebase/drkonqi to work (runtime dependency).

2003-06-07 Mario Scalas <mario.scalas@libero.it>
        * Stepped back from using Pimpl in part design since it does only complicate code without any of its
          advantages in this case
        * Added an option for adding the message for the commit operation to the master ChangeLog
          (located in <projectDirectory>/ChangeLog): await for comments for further changes.

2003-05-16 Jakob Simon-Gaarde <jakob@simon-gaarde.dk>
    * Trollproject: Support for custom installation groups or qmake install objects
      Each install object tells "make install" to copy user specified filesgroups to
      a certain location.
      example:
         doxy.files += docs/*.html \
                       docs/*.css
         doxy.path = /usr/doc/appname

    * parts/debugger
    - Sync source with thread patch in kdevelop2.1.x. Some bits were missed

            due to an extra line output (which may be gdb version dependent).

          instance variables should no longer need to be accessed directly.
          Java plugin api sources regenerated to use the new accessor method names
2001-07-02  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Doc index dialog remembers checked indices and

          as all its contents are covered elsewhere
        * Added PHP identifier index
        * Doc tree view configurable on a per-project basis,
          currently preconfigured by the app wizard and
          import dialog; no user interface
2001-06-29  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>

        * Separated project options widget in 4 separate widgets
          instead of one tab widget and embedded them
          into the general project options dialog. This is
          more intuitive for the user and doesn't expose
          KDevelop's internal structure so much
        * App wizard fixes and improvements in the project file structure
        * Configurable builddir (not used yet)
        * Configurable environment variables for program run

2001-06-13  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Rewritten Add target dialog. Supports additional
          LDFLAGS now. Will add a context menu item 'Add KDE plugin'
          later which will set KDE_PLUGIN stuff as default
        * Added a special kde mode to autoproject part.
2001-06-12  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * New part regexptest for testing regular expressions
        * Fixed make frontend to recognize ftnchek messages
          correctly
        * Changed make frontend api again so that the dir is
          given as parameter. Necessary for finding the
          directory of an erroneous file when only one
          directory is built
        * Rerun configure when project options have changed.
2001-06-11  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Allow several commands for the make frontend to be queued
        * Project management automatically runs configures if no
          Makefile exists and Makefile.cvs if no configure script
          exists
2001-06-10  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Don't show Fortran options for gcc
        * Enabled class view fixes from 06-05 :-)
        * More import project types
2001-06-09 Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Started to move the kwrite code from lib to the part.
        * Added additional kwrite functions to the menues.
2001-06-05 Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Reenabled the signals when files are loaded and
          saved, so Bernd can test ;)
          (This was a hotfix, I will do the real one later)
2001-06-05  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added Add application desktop file dialog
        * Fixed Add service dialog
        * Some fixes in class view that I can't test currently...
2001-06-04 Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Added DCOP bindings to the editor interfaces,
          so they are accessible for scripting.
2001-06-03  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * New add service dialog in project management
          Not quite ready
        * Bug fixes in sub project and target options dialog
2001-06-02  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * New sub project and target options dialogs.
          These are much more user-friend wrt convenience
          libraries and include directories within the
          project. Furthermore, the libtool options are
          presented in documented check boxes
        * Put compiler options widget into the project
          options framework
2001-06-01  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Reimplemented the modified-on-disk check with the new
          editor-interface.
        * Reimplemented the modified check before quitting.
        * Added "Save all" and "Revert all"
        * Added "Revert" to the editor interface.
2001-05-31  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Made some dom writing code more robust by
          creating non-existent nodes in the tree
        * Rewrote the import dialog to allow the choice between
          a number of import templates
2001-05-31 Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * switched to the new editor interface concept

        * added errormessage parser/view (phpsupport)

2001-05-31  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
        * Added a Java JNI based plugin api, and a corresponding
          project template for building a plugin. Java parts are
          not built if a --without-java flag is used for configuration,
          or if no suitable versions of javac, jar etc are found.
2001-05-31  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added a zillion other languages to ctags tag mappings
        * Regular expression matching in ctags part
        * Tell user about dot in configure
2001-05-30  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added a ctags part
2001-05-30  Thomas Fromm <tf@tfromm.com>
        * Added basic Highlighting for PHP
2001-05-29  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>

        * Added TOCs for perl, python and PHP to the
          documentation tree
        * Added python documentation index
        * Made file view aware of files added to and
          removed from the project
        * Added 'subdirs' files to KDE app templates
        * Fixed project management regexps for tabs
        * Fixed project management to properly emit addedFile signals
        * Fixed auto project behaviour for prefixes with underscores
        * LIBADD is for libraries, LDADD for programs
        * Implemented 'Add prefix' dialog
        * Show progress dialog when parsing files
        * Implemented Remove file dialog in project management.
          Does not quite work yet :-(
2001-05-25  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added FORTRAN 77 parser
        * Added plugins for g77 and the Portland Group's
          f77 compiler and High Performance Fortran
          compiler driver
2001-05-24 Sandy Meier   <smeier@kdevelop.org>
        * added option (load last project on startup)
        * saved mainview configuration on exit
2001-05-24  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added templates for GNOME app and simple automake-
          based C and C++ programs
2001-05-23  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Fixed file view and made it possible to add new
          groups and change the order of matched patterns
        * Added preliminary fortran support part with a
          ftnchek configuration dialog. Parser follows later...
2001-05-22  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added a new part 'FileView' which shows all files of
          a project sorted in groups like 'Sources' and
          'User Interface'. The groups can be configured
          by the user. A default setting is provided by the
          application wizard.
2001-05-20 Sandy Meier   <smeier@kdevelop.org>
        * added initial PHP support including a simple php parser
        * added "hello world" PHP template to AppWizard
2001-05-20  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Added a new editor interface for debugging
          (breakpoints etc.)
        * Added cast methods to the editor interfaces, so
          you don't have to pass strings around any longer
2001-05-19  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added kicker, kioslave and kcmodule templates
        * Each template can define an icon which is
          shown in the app wizard
        * The Big KInstance Cleanup
2001-05-19  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Added a plugin to provide and configure a
          Tools menu.
2001-05-17  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Categorized all parts into Global or Project,
          so that they are either loaded at startup or
          at project loading time
        * Added part selector which allows to configure
          the used parts both globally and on a per-
          project basis
2001-05-14  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Back to KDialogBase for configuration dialogs
2001-05-13  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added a project options dialog to which any
          plugin can add a tab.
        * Debugger configuration dialog
        * Temporarily gone back to QTabDialog for these
          configuration dialogs instead of KDialogBase.
          Not sure if this is right...
2001-05-13  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>

        * Added a status interface to the editor interfaces
        * Implemented display of editor status in the main
           statusbar
2001-05-12  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Changed compiler frontend to use QTextView, instead of QListBox.
          Now copy&paste are possible, and the view scrolls to the end of the
          output (unless the user has clicked otherwise)
        * Also fixed the shortcuts
        * Fixed buffer menu for documentation parts
2001-05-11  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Commited the new editor framework
          Note that it is not yet active, as it is not yet
          complete. But it is evolving...
2001-05-10  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added Python Hello world template
        * Fixed memory leaks
        * Fixed project files in templates to include mainprogram variable
        * Fixed script project to not show . and .. and to go to a source
          file when it is clicked
        * Implemented printing
2001-05-09  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Implemented proper comparing of file identities:
          Instead of the file name, now devno/inode are compared.
          Important for NFS systems, where file names may have
          a prefix like /tmp_mnt in some occasions
          This was already implemented in the HEAD branch
          before the old one ;-)
        * Implemented KDevCore::gotoFile() as a generic method
          to "go" to a file. Works for arbitrary mime types.
        * Implemented KDevCore::revertAllFiles()
        * Warning dialogs when modified files are closed or when
          saved/loaded files were modified outside.
        * Implemented searching html widget
2001-05-08  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Use flex instead of $(LEX)
        * Made function prototypes in tokenizer.l static.
          Not making them 'static' explicitly makes them
          'extern' and causes a conflict
        * Removed tokenizer.cpp from cvs, so it gets
          generated at build time
2001-05-05  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>

        * prepared the Tip-of-the-Day plugin to make use of the
          KTipDialog class that will soon appear in kdelibs.
2001-05-01  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
        * Removed hard coded java classpaths, and classnames. They are derived
          from the projectDirectory and mainProgram project attributes.
        * Checked in jdb front end code from Oliver Strutynski. He comments:
          'I finished work on a first version of JDB Support. It is not at
          all feature complete (setting breakpoints does not work yet, hangs
          from time to time) but could serve as a starting point for further
          development. The directory contains a README describing some of the
          parsing in the jdbcontroller.'
2001-04-29  Sandy Meier  <smeier@kdevelop.org>
        * some changes in appwizard gui (qtdesigner based),
        templates can have a category property now
2001-04-27  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Implemented a generic project part for scripting languages.
          It essentially consists of a widget that displays all files
          in all subdirectories.
        * Changed the class view to respect the feature set of the used
          language. I.e. for example for python the sections with
          variables are not displayed, as in python variables are not
          declared.
        * Sanitized project loading: The user now chooses the project
          file in a file dialog, not the directory. The kapp, kpart
          and kpartplugin appwizard scripts install a project file now.
        * Replaced the persistence stuff (which was not yet used) in the
          classstore with serialization routines based on QDataStream.
          In principle, we could now send them around via DCOP :-)
        * Implemented a python support part with parser
        * Implemented a perl support part with parser
2001-04-22  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Made configure arguments configurable
          Patch by Berndt Josef Wulf <wulf@dingo.ping.net.au>
        * Don't link with libfl in cppsupport and javasupport
        * Each part now uses its own instance and the corresponding
          resource directory
2001-04-18  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
        * GDB debugger part sources copied to 'parts/javadebugger', and all names
          changed to JDB ones. Ready to add jdb functionality.
2001-04-17  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Moved the splitter widget to lib/util, so it can be shared with parts
        * Moved the editor part to lib/kwrite, to allow parts to access it.
        * Added astyle part, a source code reformatter.
2001-04-13  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
        * Applied patch from Oliver Strutynski to fix bug in the Java tokenizer
          with non US-ASCII identifiers in source files.
2001-04-11  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Added a plugin that let's you select the parts to load
          on startup
        * Added some code to core to only load the plugins selected.
2001-04-10  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added memory view widget
        * Fixed disassemble widget to act only when it is visible
        * Added examine core file and attach to process
        * Cleaning widget after the debugger has finished
        * Added status bar text and whats this
        * Clear execution point mark when debugger has finished
2001-04-10  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * added a part to display a "Tip of the day"
        * moved over the tips from the previous HEAD branch,
          which probably need a review
2001-04-09  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Rewritten the icon border stuff from 1.x for use
          with multiple views per document
        * Ported the debugger frontend
2001-04-06  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
        * Added Java and Objective-C class browsing, and Java KDE project template and
        automake support (ie the _JAVA primary). Fixed bug in class browser where a
        method's arguments were not being displayed (was that a bug or a feature?).
        Clicking on a class's instance variables in the class browser now works and
        takes you to the source file.
