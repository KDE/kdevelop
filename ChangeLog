2000-10-30 Sandy Meier <smeier@kdevelop.org>
	* added kdevdlg2ui (tool by Bernd Gehrmann <bernd@kdevelop.org> to convert kdevelop dialogs to qt designer dialogs)
	* added new splashscreen for KDevelop1.3 (by Ralph Kocher)

2000-10-29 Ralf Nolden <nolden@kde.org>
  * after a constructive night and a looong day the templates are ready to go with
    kde-common/admin --hooraay !
  * this needed a *lot* of fixes of the file handling but it works
  * we need coolo in the about box...

2000-10-29 Martin Piskernig <mpiskernig@kdevelop.org>
  * added kimport script by Ulrich Eckhardt <doomster@knuut.de> which writes a .kdevprj file for solely automake/autoconf-based projects

2000-10-28 Ralf Nolden <nolden@kde.org>
  * added check for a Makefile in make clean in the base project dir, otherwise use subdir
  * added support for subdir sources translation in linugist as well as INTERFACES line (although it seems linguist
    doesn앖 support that right now - or am I wrong here ?)
  * updated Qt 2.2 templates and KDE MDI template -- the mdi templates still crash on exiting the app in the eventFilter() so if
    someone has a useful idea how to fix that...

2000-10-27 Ralf Nolden <nolden@kde.org>
  * updated installer for linguist, gimp, kbabel (preferred over ktranslator if found)
  * added Qt linguist support for KDevelop압 Qt 2 projects. Allows adding translations, make messages and
    automatic LFV group for translation files, *.qm files are directly included with the project so only the
    installation destination has to be set by the programmer. linguist is called on opening ts files, lupdate and lrelease
    to generate/update translations.
  * added make command to make user manuals in doc dir of kde2 projects so docbook files get generated and set default HTML page
    for the doctree/helpmenu to projectdir/doc/en/HTML/index.html
  * fixed bug in sgml error parsing pointing to wrong file, now this works with docbook as well as with sgml ;-)

  * fixed *small* bug in make clean ;-) getSubDir() is not always getProjectDir() and I had to recompile KDevelop instead of that
    test program...@!$#

  * there is NO dependency problem as written below on 10-18 for designer files. am_edit handles that.

2000-10-27 Falk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
  * Another new Feature!:
    Now you can set any program at any location as executable that will be started on "Execute" or "Debug".
    It is useful for shared object projects or multi-processes projects to start the master binary.
    (Use the project settings for that)

2000-10-18 Falk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
  * added Make Clean

2000-10-18 Ralf Nolden <nolden@kde.org>
  * updated qt2 templates, mdi template uses QAction as well, fixed up am_edit for
    using tr instead of i18n and not adding klocale.h for qt templates
  * updated manual to a 1.3 release adding info about using Qt designer - not finished yet
  * updated kde2 templates for new am_edit, uic check as well, MDI template does not use KAction yet and crashes on exit...
  * dependency problem still unsolved as ui files get processed at the end of compiling which causes
    a problem if the header is included before...anyone a clue how to fix that ? (this is for all templates)
  *PLEASE TEST THIS STUFF !!!

2000-10-10 Ralf Nolden <nolden@kde.org>
	* updated qt2 sdi application: removed kunload error in am_edit,
	rewrote template to make use of QAction stuff - resource.h is now
	obsolete and has to be removed from the kdevelop perl script...

2000-09-07  Ralf Funken <RFunken@kdevelop.de>
	* Updated de.po and kdevelop.pot 

2000-09-05 Ralf Nolden <nolden@kde.org>
        * updated KDE2normal project template to use KAction stuff+XML rc file
          testproject crashes for me when using uncommented fileClose KAction-please test!
        * updated processes.pl.in for the rc file and removal of resource.h

2000-09-02 Ralf Nolden <nolden@kde.org>
	* fixed CProject to treat *.ui designer files as SOURCE for Makefile.am압
	* updated KDE2 and Qt2 templates to current KDE automake/autoconf
          stuff including support for Qt designer - it should work now. Please keep
          in mind to add klocale.h to your ui file in designer to avoid compiler
          errors for i18n() in KDE projects.

2000-07-07 jbb <jbb@kdevelop.de>
      * Applied patches
        - Dialog Editor problem w/ QSpinBox (fix: Steven Suson <suson@TuckerEnery.com>)
