<title>Introduction</title>

<para>As everything on earth has it's fashions, today's computer world seems to tend more to the use of free software even for
commercial purpose. The most popular free software project is Linux. It is now generally agreed that Linux, (as well as other projects
such as the Apache web server, the Perl language and GNU suite of tools), proves that free software can be of as high a quality as
commercial software. But despite the quality, end users must still suffer under the cryptic commands of any Unix Systems.For Linux to
thrive, it needs applications, both free and commercial, and ease of use.</para>

<para>The KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> project tries to close this gap by providing an easy to use desktop and the companion libraries to extend the variety of
available GUI <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>GUI</primary></indexterm>-based software. But especially as free software is often made in the author's free time, the question for many
programmers is how much they like the current code development environment. KDevelop wants to take another major step: making the
programmer's life easier and more efficient: products created with KDevelop can reach a higher level of reliability and functionality
in the same development period.</para>

<para>To fulfill this goal, the KDevelop Integrated Development Environment provides many features that developers need as well as it
wraps the functionality of third party projects such as <literal remap="tt">make</literal> and the GNU C++ Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm>s and makes them an invisible, integrated
part of the development process. KDevelop manages:</para>

<para>KDevelop makes it a joy to work with all programs in one place and saves time by automating standard development processes
as well as giving you direct and transparent access to all information you need. The integrated browsing mechanisms are designed
to support documentation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>documentation</primary></indexterm> requests that developers have in conjunction with their project.</para>

<para>The class viewer <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>class viewer</primary></indexterm> and error finder bring you anywhere in the project code with a mouse click without needing to search for files;
File trees give direct access to the project files <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>project files</primary></indexterm> and the integrated help system offers superb access to online-documentation from
anywhere within the IDE.</para>

<title>Changes</title>

<para>Version 1.2 of KDevelop comes along with the most needed facilities for C/C++ development. During the development phase of KDevelop,
the project made great improvements since the 1.0 final release, followed by the release of version 1.1. We believe that the current
version is to be expected as the final release for the KDE 1.x series, giving developers the environment they want to use.</para>

<para>Improvements were made in the following sections:</para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<sect1 id="about-the-kdevelop-project">
<title>About the KDevelop Project</title>

<para>The KDevelop project was started in summer of 1998 after KDE 1.0 was available on Linux/Unix to make the 
attempt of creating an easy to use C/C++ IDE for programmers, especially targeting on the KDE desktop. Since 
then the project has found a lot of helpers and supporters as well as sponsors who want to help the team 
continue their work on this now widely recognized programming environment. Within one and a half year, the IDE 
developed to a full-featured KDE application with the most possible functionality and stability as the 
creators started to develop the IDE with the IDE itself at the time enough usability was given. Therefore bugs 
were mostly found by the authors and could be fixed very quickly as well as needed extensions for programming 
KDE applications. </para>

<para>The first official stable release was made with version 1.0 on December 6, 1999. Thereafter, the KDevelop Team 
introduced more features and stability into the IDE by new code or code that was unstable before, which lead 
to the second release as version 1.1 on February 28, 2000. </para>

<para>Since then, the project continud to integrate more functionality and simplifying the current codebase along
with many translators who transfer KDevelop to as most languages as possible to provide the international 
developer community the IDE in their own language, including the handbooks that ship with it. Many users 
contributed their experience and knowledge to the project as one of the most promising products for Linux/Unix 
developers to make it even more stable and portable to other Unices.</para>

<para>KDevelop can be found either on the KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> Applications page at <ulink url="http://www.kde.org/current.html">\|\|</ulink> or on the KDevelop
homepage at <ulink url="http://www.kdevelop.org">\|\|</ulink>. KDevelop is also available on Linux distributions, such
as SuSE 6.1.</para>

<para>We're also offering snapshots of the KDevelop CVS repository on our homepage for those who want to stay up to date with
KDevelop. Usually, the snapshots are not intended to be used for production but as a test for new features and to give an insight
into development progress of the KDevelop team. Also we offer various third party software needed by KDevelop directly such as
KDoc <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDoc</primary></indexterm> and KDbg <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDbg</primary></indexterm>.</para>

<para>If you're experiencing problems with compiling or using KDevelop, please read the <link linkend="Questions-and-Answers">Questions and Answers</link> section of this handbook or the FAQ-file included with the KDevelop package. If your problem is not addressed, please
subscribe to the KDevelop mailing list at <ulink url="mailto:kdevelop-request@barney.cs.uni-potsdam.de">kdevelop-request@barney.cs.uni-potsdam.de</ulink> by sending a mail with an empty header and "subscribe youremailaddress" as contents. Requests and
problem report should only target the usage of the KDevelop IDE and not towards any questions that regard any implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm> problem you
may have while coding your own application. Anyway, all mails send to the mailing list should be written in English, so that all participants can
take part on discussions and are able to provide better help. The mailing list is also intended for those users willing to contribute and who found
solutions for any problems they experienced, so we can fix errors <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>errors</primary></indexterm> and include that knowledge to give beginners an even more qualified
first-hand help.</para>

<para>An good way to report problems is to send the output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm> you get by starting kdevelop from the console or to copy and paste the
contents of KDevelop's internal Messages-window <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Messages-window</primary></indexterm>.</para>

<para> If KDoc <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDoc</primary></indexterm> was detected, you are asked to create/update your KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm>-library documentation.  For that, you need to have the
kde-libraries in source form. For Linux-Users who have installed KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> from a distribution, we suggest to copying and extracting
the source of the kdelibs-package to your system; Free BSD users who installed the kdelibs as a package should look for their according
distfile package of the ports-collection.   If none of these cases match your situation, you should download the sources from <ulink url="http://www.kde.org">\|\|</ulink> and untar the sources on your system. If you wish to use the documentation package provided by <ulink url="http://developer.kde.org">\|\|</ulink>, cancel the creation and continue with creating the search index <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>search index</primary></indexterm>. After the installer finished
and KDevelop has been started, set the path to the extracted documentation package in the KDevelop Setup dialog and run the search
index <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>search
index</primary></indexterm> setup <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>setup</primary></indexterm> again, which can be found at the same setup <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>setup</primary></indexterm> page of the dialog.

The "Update KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm>-Library documentation" dialog is set up to use a default path for the location of the documentation in
$(HOME)/.kde/share/apps/kdevelop/KDE-Documentation.  The only thing you have to do is choosing the path to your library sources you
extracted on the system with the selection button on top of the dialog and press OK. As an example, if you got the kdelibs.tar.gz
package from <ulink url="http://www.kde.org">\|\|</ulink> and downloaded it to your home directory, you should open a console or terminal and enter
"tar zxvf kdelibs.tar.gz". This will untar the sources into a directory $HOME/kdelibs, which then contains the sources for each library
in a subdirectory, e.g. for kdecore, this would be in /home/rnolden/kdelibs/kdecore. Now, the path you have to enter in the KDE-Library
documentation dialog would be the path to all libraries, in the example /home/rnolden/kdelibs. After pressing the OK button, a message
in the installation window shows that the documentation generation is in progress and you should wait for the next message.</para>

<chapter id="programs">
<title>Programs</title>

<para>Now that KDevelop installed successfully and the most commonly used options are set, you are probably wondering if it keeps what
it promises. This Chapter gives you a guideline to how programs are created using the GNU tools in general and especially what
part KDevelop plays in this game.</para>

<sect1 id="the-compiler">
<title>The Compiler</title>

<para>The Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> is actually the program on your system that has to be installed as a minimum to create running programs; he is the
one that compiles the source code into object files and creates the program.</para>

<para>Normally, you would start like this:
Open an editor of your choice - don't use a word-processor. Type in something like this to create the source for your first
program:</para>

<para><screen>#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

int main(){

cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World" &lt;&lt; endl;

}
</screen>

Well, actually all the program will do is to print out the string "Hello World" to your standard output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm>. But this is just the
source code for the program to be build, not the program itself. Therefore, we need a Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm>, in this case a C++-Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> like
g++. Then we can save the file with the source code, as, let's say, myprogram.cpp and invoke the Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> with the filename
(on a console):</para>

<para><screen>g++ -o myprogram myprogram.cpp
</screen>

Then we can start our program- just type <literal remap="tt">myprogram</literal>  on the console, and the program prints out the string; then exits.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="make">
<title>Make and Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm>s</title>

<para>I have everything I need: an editor, a Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> and I can execute my own C++ program. But it isn't all that easy. What happens if
you have more than one source file ? And, do you have to compile all sources over and over again only if you changed one file ?
Compiling will become more and more complicated and time-consuming, because you have to type in all the commands and options
yourself. Therefore, you could write a so-called "Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm>". You could also call it some other name except the name of the program
to build. Then, you should have the tool <literal remap="tt">make</literal> or <literal remap="tt">gmake</literal> installed, or any other tool that is capable of keeping track of
a project's compilation. Insert all your Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> commands in a certain syntax into that Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm> and save it; then you will only
have to type <literal remap="tt">make</literal> or <literal remap="tt">gmake</literal> on the console in the directory where your Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm> is located, and then make takes over,
leading the Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> to create your application. The make utility has many other advantages and can be used to a lot of purposes.
To get a complete overview, open a console and type:</para>

<para><literal remap="tt">man make</literal></para>

<para>or search for "GNU Make" in KDEHelp, "System GNU Info contents".
At least, you have an insight, why a developer needs the make utility for making it easier to compile his application.
Now, writing Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm>s is not only handwork until now, you also have to dig yourself into the whole syntax and options. But here
is the good news about KDevelop and any Make-utility: You just have to set the Make-Command in the <link linkend="General-Configuration">KDevelop Setup</link> dialog, and then you're done. All projects generated with KDevelop will use that Make command to build the
target application, and no typing at all. Just hit the buttons on the toolbar of KDevelop, beginning with the one after the second
separator line, or choose the desired function for Make in the "Build" menu.</para>

<para>The toolbar and the build-menu then offer the most-common functions that you need to let make do the dirty work:</para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para> Compile File <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compile File</primary></indexterm>: is only active if you're working on a source file. It invokes make with the correct command to compile only
the current source.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para> Make: just calls make and creates your target.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para> Rebuild all: rebuilds the whole project</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para> Clean/Rebuild all: cleans the project directory first and then runs make again.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para> Stop Build: cancels the current process- this is mostly used if you watch make working and staring at your sources. Then-
ahh- I forgot about this line...and you have to correct your code. Just hit Stop, correct the error you found by yourself and run
Make again.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>But this is not the only way how KDevelop works together with make- for KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> applications, there are some things that are special,
like creating the message files for internationalization. These functions are also included, so no worry about these things
anymore.</para>

<para>Until now, you know about sources, the Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> and why make is needed. In the next section, we'll discuss how it comes that
projects created with KDevelop automatically can be compiled on most other Unix-platforms using the <literal remap="tt">configure-</literal> script.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="configure">
<title>Configure</title>

<para>The title of this section lets you probably question: Configure ? What has to be configured ? Or who ?
Well, assume you have written a program including a Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm>. Then you like to distribute it, but the binary compiled does only
run on your system or on systems that are compatible with yours. To support other platforms like different Unix-systems or
machines like Alpha's or RISC's, you have to recompile the program. The easiest way would be to copy the source package to the
target machine and run <literal remap="tt">make</literal> again. But what if the target machine uses another Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> command or has in some other way a
problem to build your binary ? Not to mention more difficult issues like installation paths for your program and documentation-
e.g. KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> can be installed in <literal remap="tt"></literal>opt/kde/ on one machine, while it is installed under <literal remap="tt"></literal>usr/local/kde/ on another. In this
case, you would have to rewrite the Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm> each time to ensure a correct compilation and installation of your product.</para>

<para>Fortunately, GNU-tools have even more to provide than that mighty <literal remap="tt">make</literal>- the commonly used automake <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>automake</primary></indexterm> and autoconf <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>autoconf</primary></indexterm>
packages. It sounds good to hear something with "auto"- seems like something about application design can be done quick and easy,
which exactly hits the point.</para>

<para>Automake's purpose is generally to create a so-called <literal remap="tt">Makefile.in <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile.in</primary></indexterm></literal> from a file <literal remap="tt">Makefile.am <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile.am</primary></indexterm></literal> which you have to write for
your project. This Makefile.am <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile.am</primary></indexterm> consists of macros which can be interpreted and reduce the complexity that make offers, so a
Makefile.am <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile.am</primary></indexterm> is written safer and quicker than the final Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm>.</para>

<para>Having this said, who is finally creating me my Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm> ? Now, here comes autoconf <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>autoconf</primary></indexterm>. Autoconf requires several macro files
for the project. That are those Makefile.in <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile.in</primary></indexterm>'s generated by automake <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>automake</primary></indexterm> and a file called <literal remap="tt">configure.in</literal>, also containing macros.
Hereby the Makefile.am <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile.am</primary></indexterm> and .in's are containing macros that are responsible for the way how to build the software in terms of
which sources have to be compiled, which files belong to the package and what name the final binary or library will have after a
build. Configure.in on the other hand contains macros for what the final configure-shell script will check for on the system
configure is executed. Those could be e.g. the Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> command, required libraries against which the final binary will be linked,
include-files the project needs and their location.</para>

<para>For example you want to write a KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> application. After writing your sources,
you want to distribute the program to the user community, and each user has to compile the binary on his own. Then you would write
a configure.in file that contains the macros for a KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm>-compliant application. That one macro finally expands to a check on the
system whether the Qt-library is installed, checks for the Qt-header files, the KDE-libraries <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-libraries</primary></indexterm> and headers etc.</para>

<para><emphasis remap="bf">Summary:</emphasis>  To create a GNU-compliant application that is portable to different Unix-OS's and machines other than yours,
you will need to do the following:</para>

<para><orderedlist><listitem>
<para> write the sources of your project</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para> write a Makefile.am <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile.am</primary></indexterm> for each subdirectory, including the main project directory of your project</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para> write a configure.in file placed in the main project directory containing the macros for system requirements</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para> run automake <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>automake</primary></indexterm></para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para> run autoconf <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>autoconf</primary></indexterm></para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<para>Then the main work is done. Automake creates the Makefile.in <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile.in</primary></indexterm>'s, autoconf <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>autoconf</primary></indexterm> processes the configure.in and
generates an executable shell script called <literal remap="tt">configure</literal>. All you then have to do is to execute it with  <literal remap="tt">.</literal>configure/ and
the script will run the checks of your choice. Finally Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm>s will be generated that allow a final execution of make (or gmake)
that will process all Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm>s and then you're done.</para>

<para>This seems to be a lot of stuff for writing a small application and much to learn especially how to write correct macros. But even
the fact that you provide a compilation on almost all Unix-systems will be worth this work sooner or later. Finally, you only have
to do this work once for your project and in case your project's files increase you only have to add the filenames to the macros.</para>

<para>Now, how far does KDevelop support this kind of application development and how complicated does it get for the programmer ?
The good news is, that you don't even have to know anything about macros and scripts. All details are hidden behind an easy to use
graphical interface doing the work for you. An application is therefore created with GNU tools in a very user-friendly way:</para>

<para>Just generate your application with KAppWizard <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KAppWizard</primary></indexterm>, by the choice of your application's needs- may it be a pure C++ terminal
application or a kind of GUI <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>GUI</primary></indexterm> program using Qt or the Qt/KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> libraries. All work is done automatically and your project
already contains the Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm>s that are created by an auto-execution of the GNU-tools and the configure-script.</para>

<para>This is it- you're ready to extend the source of your project, may it be by adding classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm>, dialogs, translations or
documentation, which is also completely automated. Just concentrate on the real work of the developer, which is providing
functionality for the final application that you want to create. In most cases, you probably won't come in touch with Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm>s at
all when using KDevelop.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="debugging">
<title>Debugging</title>

<para>The following section covers a term that is widely used by developers: Debugging.  It means, that, although your Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> produces
the final application, your application may not run or crash during execution due to a so-called "bug" in the code. A program
error described by the name of this insect comes from the history of computing; one of the first errors <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>errors</primary></indexterm> that caused a machine to
crash was not obviously a malfunction- bugs were inside the computer which were responsible for it. Therefore, an error not
detectable on the first look is called a "bug", so "debugging <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>debugging</primary></indexterm>" means to throw out bugs where they shouldn't be. Now, you don't
have to hunt them for real; assuming that today's computers are designed to keep them out by some kind of outer protection.
They have to be found inside the code, mostly ending the execution of a program with the message "Segmentation fault". GNU
provides another tool called <literal remap="tt">gdb</literal>, the GNU debugger. This terminal program allows to watch the internal values of an
application and the execution step by step with setting "breakpoints" in the code. Gdb stops the execution every time the program
comes to a breakpoint while executing. But like most other tools, the debugger is handled by another program providing a frontend
to it, allowing to easily watch values and the setting of breakpoints in the code.</para>

<para>For this purpose, your project's application is by default created with a Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> option for debugging <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>debugging</primary></indexterm>, thereby storing
additional data in the executable to allow the localization of values and lines in the code. As a third-party frontend to gdb,
KDevelop makes use of KDbg <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDbg</primary></indexterm>, the KDebugger. To debug your program, you just have to select "Debug" in the Build-menu or press the
according toolbar button displayed by a wheel having glasses over it, signaling that you want to watch the execution.</para>

<para>KDevelop then opens the Tools <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Tools</primary></indexterm>-window and starts your application with KDbg <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDbg</primary></indexterm>. The KDbg <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDbg</primary></indexterm> interface appears inside the Tools <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Tools</primary></indexterm>-window and
allows the usage just like you started it from outside.</para>

<para>In general, the above steps are clearly showing the need of certain steps that a developer has to do when starting to write his
own application, and cover issues that are common to all projects. Also, we explained what part KDevelop does for a developer and
how it supports the idea of providing an easy way to Unix programming. To get further information about the role and purpose of
GNU tools, you should read the documentation provided with them, commonly accessed via the <literal remap="tt">man</literal> command or by the "System GNU
Info contents" section in KDEHelp.</para>

<chapter id="development-with-kdevelop">
<title>Development with KDevelop</title>

<para>In this chapter you will get a general overview how you can use KDevelop and the internal dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> to create own applications.
Thereby, all tools are described by their use during the development process. If you are a beginner in C++/GUI <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>GUI</primary></indexterm> design and
programming, you should read <ulink url="programming/index.html">The KDevelop Programming Handbook</ulink>, which describes some
basics for program design and shows a more detailed use of KDevelop by sample projects which you can follow step-by-step to get used
with the way applications are created using KDevelop. Also you should have read chapter <link linkend="Programs">Programs</link> to gain a
general understanding why Unix applications should make use of provided development tools; this will make things easier when you hit
references to what Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm>s are etc.</para>

<sect1 id="what-are-kdevelop-project-applications">
<title>What are KDevelop Project Applications ?</title>

<para>Projects created with KDevelop make it very easy for developers to use the GNU standard development tools. In opposition to the
self-creation of Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm>s, which have to be written anyway because of the project's complexity, those provide not only a better
way of Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm> generation but also a good and safe way to provide a fast adaption towards different systems by autoconf <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>autoconf</primary></indexterm>-generated
<literal remap="tt">configure</literal> scripts.</para>

<para>The distribution of your applications does not require the end-user to have anything different installed than a C++ Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> and
the development libraries, which is most often the case; but you can as well distribute binary packages of your application. In
either way, the end-user of your product does not have to have KDevelop installed. For giving away your sources, we advise to
include the project file of KDevelop as well, as this makes it very easy for other developers to work with your sources if they
use KDevelop as well. For projects where several developers, maybe working on different places, are involved, this should the case
anyway to ensure consistency of the Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm>s so you don't run into trouble. Especially on multi language applications, translators
won't actually work with the source code, except in cases that require corrections for enabling translation support. Anyway, those
will be thankful as KDevelop simplifies their work to a minimum by adding their language and reducing the work to concentrate on
the translation.</para>

<para>With using KDevelop for your own projects, you would start creating a new application with the KAppWizard <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KAppWizard</primary></indexterm>. There, you can also
set the project type according the goals of your program. Then, you would start developing the user interface by adding
widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm> that are already constructed in the libraries and only have to be called by your application, or by self-constructions
that can be made with the dialog editor. Next comes the extension of the user interface by changing and extending those parts that
are already made by KDevelop like the statusbar, menubar and toolbars. As resources are collected in a resource file, this can be
extended simply by adding new values to the already existing one; the given resources can also be used as a guideline for adding
your specific ones. After implementing the functionality to methods that are either generated empty by the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> or already
containing code for standard user actions, you should extend the User Manual by simply editing the provided SGML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>SGML</primary></indexterm> index file
towards describing your applications capabilities. The last step would be to generate translation files and to distribute your
project to translators doing the rest to enhance internationalization.</para>

<para>But even for non-GUI <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>GUI</primary></indexterm> application designers the IDE offers an easy way to create new projects; the editor and Class Browser in
conjunction with KDevelop's powerful project management will reduce the time for development to the minimum that is required for
implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm> of functionality.</para>

<para>With KDevelop you have chosen a package, that, in conjuction with the use of other tools, will provide you a prefect and flexible
environment for object-orientated application development under Unix-Systems. Generally, KDevelop consists of the programming
environment and the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm>; besides that all needed programs that can be helpful for designing applications are embedded in
one or the other way.</para>

work that development processes usually burden on the programmer. The ease of use make writing applications for Unix an enjoyment

your project throughout all its details, keep the overview over your classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> and don't have to use additional consoles for your

<title>The Dialog Editor</title>

<para>KDevelop's built-in dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> offers a simple way of designing user interfaces with the Qt and KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> libraries. Its
simple way to do almost everything with the mouse allows a rapid construction of dialogs and main views for applications and their
direct transformation into C++ code, which is directly added to the project. As the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> is embedded into the rest of
KDevelop's user interface, you have the same commands available than working in Programming mode. This allows e.g. construction of a
dialog, generation of the code output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm> and it's direct testing within the program by the availability of the make-command <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>make-command</primary></indexterm>s and you still
can control the Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm> without having to switch back to the programming view. For a detailed description, see <link linkend="The-Dialog-Editor">\|\|</link>.</para>

that already contains a lot of functionality (for KDE and Qt projects), without even having to type one line of C++ code yourself. When
specifying the complete set of options the program generator offers, your application already contains:

<title>Classtools</title>

<para>The term "Classtools" describes a variety of functions that are available for the developer to work on a project not only by
an object-orientated language but using the sources in an object-orientated way. Working with classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> instead of having to
watch for files offers a very flexible way to extend a project and lets the user concentrate on the objects the project contains.
The tools that KDevelop offers are a Classgenerator and a Class Browser, where each one provides a lot of automated
functionality.</para>

<sect4 id="creating-a-new-class-with-the-classgenerator">
<title>Creating a new class with the Classgenerator</title>

<para>After generating a project with the KAppWizard <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KAppWizard</primary></indexterm> your work as a developer would be to add a set of classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> that match the design of
the application. The typical process without using KDevelop would be to create a new header and sourcefile, add them manually to
the according Makefile.am <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile.am</primary></indexterm> and to start writing the classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> declaration <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>declaration</primary></indexterm> and implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm>. To simplify the whole process, the
Classgenerator lets you do this by only specifying the new class by its name, inherited class, inheritance attribute and further
information such as class documentation by it's purpose for the project. Additionally, you can also change the filenames that are
preset by the generator and if the class would be Qt-signal/slot enabled by default.</para>

<para>The rest of the work is done automatically- you don't have to take care for Makefile.am <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile.am</primary></indexterm>, files and the class itself. A new "make"
invocation is enough to include the new class in the compilation process. As the Class Browser updates itself after the addition of
a class, the declaration <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>declaration</primary></indexterm> and implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm> is available at once and you can start working on the extension of the class. The
Classgenerator is invoked by the Project-menu, entry "New Class <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>New Class</primary></indexterm>".</para>
</sect4>

<sect4 id="the-class-browser">
<title>The Class Browser</title>

<para>The Class Browser displays all types of objects and functions of your project in a tree left of the editing windows. A class parser
scans all files for methods and classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> and makes them available by graphical symbols. Over those, context-menus offer a
specialized functionality to work with the sources by focusing on the classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> and functions.</para>

<para>Selecting a class will result in opening the file that contains the declaration <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>declaration</primary></indexterm>; on methods and functions this will
show you the implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm>. For a full description, see <link linkend="The-Class-Browser">The Class Browser</link></para>

<title>The Development Process</title>

<para>The development of a new application with KDevelop can generally be divided into two major steps: first, you have to generate a
program skeleton with KAppWizard <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KAppWizard</primary></indexterm>, then the "rest" of the development has to be done using KDevelop's features, which only
requires your abilities as a programmer. To describe the development process, we assume you want to create a Qt/KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> application,
which implies using most of KDevelop's features for working with these types of project, so you have a general "HOW-TO".</para>

<sect2 id="creating-a-program-skeleton">
<title>Creating a Program Skeleton</title>

<para>To start creating your application, you normally would call the KAppWizard <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KAppWizard</primary></indexterm>, enter the project name and generate the program. By
this, the wizard automatically creates a project file for the application and inserts the KDevelop areas into the Makefile.am <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile.am</primary></indexterm>'s
which will be used later when extending the application. The project file is the file you have to load for opening the project in
later sessions.</para>

<para>You call KAppWizard <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KAppWizard</primary></indexterm> by the "Project"-menu, entry "New...". When the wizard appears, you have to specify the project
type on the first page. Selecting "Next &gt;&gt;" brings you to the next page where you have to insert the project name, version,
directory and your personal information. Page 3 offers more detailed options, page 4 and 5 allow editing file headers for header
and implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm> files that are inserted automatically according to your selection. If you already have file headers you want to
use, you can choose those files as well. The last page contains an output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm> window and an error message window. When selecting
"Create", your application will be generated and the actions that are executed can be seen in the output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm> window. If READY appears
in the output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm> window, the KAppWizard <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KAppWizard</primary></indexterm> is finished and you can select "Exit" to return to the Programming Environment. To build the
binary, choose "Make" from the Build-menu or choose the according button in the toolbar. You can as well test the functions already
present by choosing "Execute" from the Build-menu.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="developing-an-application">
<title>Developing an Application</title>

<para>This section describes the development phase of applications with KDevelop and the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm>- and all work can be done within
the IDE.</para>

<para>The development steps are generally to edit the source files, the compilation of the project sources followed by the Linker <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Linker</primary></indexterm>
process binding all object files to the final binary. Then errors <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>errors</primary></indexterm> have to be located which either prevented a compilation or
linking or are semantical bugs that can be found by a debugging <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>debugging</primary></indexterm> session. Finally, the documentation has to be extended and
translations have to be added. But as all those steps can mix which each other, it is not that easy to describe a general way how
to develop your own application. Typically, the usual procedure would be to first create all visible parts of the project like the
main view and the dialogs for configuring any options, then generate the source code and implement all needed connections that
still have to be done like changing the menubar and toolbars, adding statusbar help for new menu entries and fill the new member
functions with objects that are displaying your dialogs. Then you would compile your application and test it's capabilities, fix
errors <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>errors</primary></indexterm> and test it again. The following sections describe how this would be done; for your particular application
you may choose another way- KDevelop leaves you enough flexibility to decide what to do at what time.</para>

<sect3 id="user-interfaces">
<title>User Interfaces</title>

<para>The User Interface of an application is actually what the user sees and by which he interacts with the program. Therefore a
program generally has a menubar, toolbars and a statusbar as well as a main view which would be e.g. a text input window for an
editor. KAppWizard <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KAppWizard</primary></indexterm> generated applications already contain a complex functionality on graphical interfaces- the frame structure
takes care of standard elements such as bars and buttons. When developing your application, you have to extend the given structure
to give the program the user interaction capability you want to provide. One part of the work is the design of dialogs e.g. for
changing values like the brush width in a paint application. This can be done easily with the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> inside KDevelop. Now,
how do you create those good-looking dialogs ? As the Qt-library <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Qt-library</primary></indexterm> is a GUI <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>GUI</primary></indexterm> toolkit, it provides a base set of so-called "widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm>"
like labels displaying plain text, lineedits for text input and buttons for navigation and selection commands. Besides these
"low-level" parts of user interfaces, standard dialogs are provided and are ready to use such as printing <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>printing</primary></indexterm> dialogs. The
KDE-libraries <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-libraries</primary></indexterm> then are based on the Qt-library and contain replacements for certain dialogs as well as additional widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm> that
can be used in your application. So, when you start designing your applications behavior towards the user, you should make yourself
comfortable with the widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm> provided with Qt and KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm>. The online-documentation of Qt offers screenshots for most of them,
so you should have a look there first. Then we advise to have a closer look at the KDE-UI library, offering other widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm>. Libraries
like the KHTML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>HTML</primary></indexterm> library contains very specialized widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm> that a lot of programs make use of. It just simplifies application design like
the predefined dialogs provided with Qt. For your own dialogs, those low-level widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm> are the one you need. A dialog merely
consists by a collection of different widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm> combined together building the interface and is technically programmed by C++ code
in a class that is derived from <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>QWidget</literal></primary></indexterm>QWidget</literal> or a more specialized dialog class that inherits <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>QWidget</literal></primary></indexterm>QWidget</literal>. The program
using the widget therefore needs an object of the widget's class- this is almost all you have to understand how dialogs or views are
used.
The dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> of KDevelop now offers a nice way to simply construct dialogs and user interfaces visually instead of you having
to combine dialogs with pure C++ code together- this is the hard way to create interfaces. Switch to the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> by
choosing the according entry in the "View"-menu (or by the toolbar button). You will see that KDevelop's face has changed but for
e.g. the menubar and the toolbar are very similar. This makes it very easy to switch back and forth between the two working modes
and you will feel comfortable in both after some time. There you can construct your views and dialogs as you like and set all
available preferences for the items the view will contain. When you're finished, select "Generate Sources" from the Build-menu;
the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> and the project management will take care of the rest. You can test if everything went OK by selecting Make or
Execute, this will build your application including your new sources. But don't expect that dialogs are already usable- this is a
matter of implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm> that is the usual way a developer works. Don't worry- this isn't too difficult, too. For more information
about creating dialogs, see <link linkend="The-Dialog-Editor">The Dialog Editor</link>, examples and guidelines can also be found in
<ulink url="programming/index-6.html">The KDevelop Programming Handbook</ulink>.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="binding-new-elements">
<title>Binding New Elements</title>

<para>After you have created your user interfaces and generated the sources, you are ready to make your application use them by objects.
As described above, a usual GUI <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>GUI</primary></indexterm>-based program contains bars and the main view; additionally the main view operates with the bars,
which are part of the main application class, and the document object which it is connected to. In terms of object-oriented
design, you would describe the given architecture as the "Document-View-Controller"-model. This model describes the basic
functions for objects in an application towards their role within the program. The Controller represents the one coordinating the
main application and provides user interaction through a menubar and additionally toolbars and a statusbar. The Document class
takes the task of representing a document the user works with. Therefore, a document class should do all actions like loading
files and saving them again. The view now is in the center of the application window, showing the user a part of the document
visually and provides all functions to manipulate the data by the user. As the bars and toolbars are already present, your work
would be to create the main view and additional dialogs by which the user can change any settings or has access to additional
functions.</para>

<para>To build your main-view, the generated source code for your application already contains a class in the form of
&&lt;;YourApplication&&gt;;View which inherits the <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>QWidget</literal></primary></indexterm>QWidget</literal> class (this is the minimal class that handles visual interfaces in Qt
and therefore in KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> as well). In general, there are three different ways how to extend the given class:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>remove the document-view structure and use one of the predefined "big" widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm> already containing a lot of functionality-
just remove the View-class and replace the view-object by another.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>change the inheritance of the View-class. Change the inheritance to e.g. QMultiLineEdit and your application would be an
editor.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>if your main view will consist of several separated parts, create the widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm> and their classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> you need with the
dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> and create objects of these classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> in the view-class constructors that in combination will build the main view.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>For dialogs, things are a bit different. The usual way would be to call a dialog through a menubar entry and additionally by a
toolbar icon. After you constructed your dialog and generated the sources, the class is available for creating an object that will
be the dialog. So you first have to look for a suitable place in the menubar to add an entry which will open the dialog when
selected by the user. If the already given menus do not match your needs, create a new popup menu just like the others and insert
your entry and the slot you want to call when the menuitem gets selected. Then implement the slot by creating an instance of the
dialog class and call the dialog with the member functions <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>member functions</primary></indexterm> given by the base class. Also you have to specify an ID for the
menuentry. The frame applications have all IDs already given collected in a file resource.h, so you only have to add the ID and
give it a new number. Then you're done- additionally you could construct another toolbar icon and add the statushelp message. Your
application now offers a new functionality which is visible to the user. Now you have to add the implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm> of methods that
your dialog will be operating with to manipulate any values. Finally, call your make-tool or "Execute" and the changed files will
be recompiled; the result of your changes can then be tested immediately.</para>

<sect3 id="the-complete-development-process">
<title>The Complete Development Process</title>

<para>Above, we discussed the usual way how to start working on a new application using KDevelop and how to extend the user interface.
Now, these are the standard steps where the IDE helps you, but KDevelop does more than providing tools for creating applications
and their visual parts. The following gives a short description of the main functionality that is offered for enhancing
application development.</para>

<sect4 id="sourcecode-management">
<title>Sourcecode Management</title>

<para>The KDevelop IDE provides a lot of methods to the programmer to achieve his goals within the shortest time.  As described above,
the KAppWizard <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KAppWizard</primary></indexterm> and the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> shorten the time you would usually need to get to the same result manually. But this
didn't cover the work a programmer has to do usually: working on the implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm> of his application to provide a proper
execution by the end-user. Now, why is KDevelop the IDE you would want to use as a coding environment, including it's use to
create even non-GUI <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>GUI</primary></indexterm> applications ?</para>

<para>Implicitly, the IDE keeps track of your project in general; that means, you don't have to take care for saving changes, the
Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm> generation and so on- this is providing full project-management, and KDevelop plays out all it's power here in any case
of C++ application development. It is easy to understand that, after taking away the management from the programmer, he is more
concentrated on working out the sourcecode. On the other hand, the code is usually spread over many different files across
the project, so you can separate certain parts. But this means still working the hard way- being the developer, you still
would have to struggle with creating these files and writing standard contents like file headers containing the date and the
author's name as well as e.g. license terms for the code. Additionally, this requires that you have to remember where your
functions, class declaration <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>declaration</primary></indexterm>s and implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm>s are in the project. Therefore, KDevelop contains the Classtools- a variety of
actions, that allow fast work and moving the developer's focus from files to objects- classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm>, structures and methods. The
classgenerator lets you create a new class including inheritance, attributes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>attributes</primary></indexterm> and documentation easily . For object-oriented work,
the Class Browser brings you to the location of your objects; it doesn't matter any more where the code is actually. The
Browser scans all sources automatically and rebuilds itself after additions to keep up with your work and enables you to access
the new code directly. By context-menus, the browser offers even more functionality, like bringing you to the implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm> or to
the declaration <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>declaration</primary></indexterm> of member functions <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>member functions</primary></indexterm>. Then, the addition of members are done graphically by dialogs- no search for the file and the
place you would have to add your entries. Finally, you can get an even more specialized view of your project's classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> by the
Classtool dialog, providing you trees that show the usage, contents and inheritance of classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> and their objects. For more
detailed information, see <link linkend="The-Class-Browser">The Class Browser</link>.</para>

<sect4 id="building-and-executing-your-application">
<title>Building and Executing your Application</title>

<para>The KDevelop IDE is specially designed to take away all those steps that you have to do periodically like building and executing
your program as well as locating errors <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>errors</primary></indexterm> in the sourcecode.</para>

<sect4 id="searching-program-errors">
<title>Searching Program Errors</title>

<para>As naturally errors <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>errors</primary></indexterm> occur either during the build-process (which are detected by the Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> and are called syntactical errors <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>errors</primary></indexterm>
because they result from a wrong syntax of the sources) or during the execution of the application, those have to be found and
removed by the programmer. For locating errors <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>errors</primary></indexterm>, the developer needs the information what exactly caused its occurance. As
mentioned, the Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> is able to detect syntax errors <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>errors</primary></indexterm> himself, resulting in that the executable can't be build (this can also
happen by the Linker <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Linker</primary></indexterm> when he detects "unresolved symbols"-see <link linkend="Linker-Options">Linker Options</link>). As he gives out a
description of the error as detailed as possible, the error can be found and removed. During the build-process, you will see the output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm>
window pop up showing you what your make-tool and the Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> has to say. In case of errors <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>errors</primary></indexterm> or warnings <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>warnings</primary></indexterm>, just press the mouse button
over the error line and the editor will open the affected file and sets the cursor to the errorline. This can also be done by the
entries in the "View"-menu, "Next Error" and "Previous Error" or by the according keyboard shortcuts <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>shortcuts</primary></indexterm>. You will find that this is very
functional and saves a lot of time to get to the error, thus for removing the cause your knowledge as a programmer is asked.</para>

<para>Runtime Errors, which occur during execution and will mostly result in a segmentation fault, are sometimes hard to find.
Therefore, you can enable the Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> to add information within the binary to watch the execution by the sourcecode. A debugger
then is another program that lets you do this by starting the application and letting you set breakpoints in the code where the
execution stops, so you can control critical implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm>s and by this detect at least the line that caused the error. Finding
the real cause is another task; it depends on the programmer to locate this. The <emphasis remap="bf">gdb</emphasis> is a debugger that is provided with the
GNU Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> and programs like <emphasis>ddd</emphasis> or <emphasis>KDbg <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDbg</primary></indexterm></emphasis> are frontends that allow an easier use. KDevelop therefore uses KDbg <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDbg</primary></indexterm> and lets
you invoke the debugging <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>debugging</primary></indexterm> process by the commands "Debug" in the Build-menu or by the "Debug" symbol in the toolbar. For more

<title>Overview</title>

<para>Looking at KDevelop, the user interface can be described by it's logical separation: the main window, the treeview and the output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm>
window, surrounded by the menubar, toolbars and the statusbar. This section describes the purpose of each part of the interface,
starting by the windows, followed by the bars and the functions they provide.</para>

<sect1 id="main-window">
<title>Main Window</title>

<para>The main window consists of four tabulators for which the left two are for editing purpose. First comes the Header-/Resource
window for headers and any other text files like the documentation SGML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>SGML</primary></indexterm>'s, then the C/C++ window for sourcecodes. These are
followed by the Documentation window displaying in HTML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>HTML</primary></indexterm>-format.

<chapter id="the-help-system">
<title>The Help System</title>

<para>Most of KDevelop's strength is accumulated in the Help System.  It is also to be understood as an example of how to extend your own
KDE application with a complete set of help functionality, and is, in part, already realized in the template applications, so
KDE/Qt application framework <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>application framework</primary></indexterm>s generated with the KAppWizard <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KAppWizard</primary></indexterm> do already contain the basic functionality for statusbar help and
documentation, that only has to be extended by the programmer. This section therefore introduces into the usage of the general
help provided within the IDE as well as to show the usage of the Helpbrowser <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Helpbrowser</primary></indexterm>, which, by intelligent use, will make it very easy to
get the information you need for development.</para>

<sect1 id="the-whats-this-button-and-quickhelp-quickhel">
<title>The "What's this ?"-Button and Quickhelp <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Quickhelp</primary></indexterm></title>

<para>Looking at KDevelop's top toolbar, you will see the "What's this?" button on the right end. By selecting the button, the cursor
will change to a pointer with a question mark on the right, as is the same as the button in the toolbar. Now, you can select any
visible part of the KDevelop user interface and click on it. This will result in displaying a help-window giving you a short
description of the function this part gives you or what it can do for you. Included are the main view, the tree-views and the
toolbars, for which every button help is provided. After another mouse click or a keyboard input, the What's this? help window
disappears and your cursor is set to the last active position. Mind, that, if you place the mouse pointer over a button, it gets
raised and after a short time, you will get a Quick-Tip-window, describing the function the button represents in the menubar; this
will disappear if you move the mouse pointer away.</para>

<para>For user interaction dialogs, Quickhelp <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Quickhelp</primary></indexterm> provides you help windows with a short description of the selected item you want help for.
These are accessed by a right-button mouse click to the item, a context-menu pops up that allows the selection of "Quick-Help".
Selecting this will pop up the help window. This is always useful for dialogs where you can't see the action's purpose for as long
as you are not familiar with KDevelop. Mind that most dialogs offer a Help-button which will show you the detailed context-help
for the dialog's options within the provided online-manual in the help-browser.</para>

<title>Help Messages</title>

<para>The statusbar informs you about the action of menu entries if you select a menu within the menubar and select an action without
executing it. Further, if you press on a toolbar icon, but without releasing the mousebutton, the help message for the button is
displayed in the same way as for the menu entries. You can prevent the execution of the selected icon by moving the mousepointer
away from the icon, still holding the button pressed. If the cursor is away, release the mousebutton.</para>

<para>For actions that are currently executed, KDevelop displays the action. This counts for processes running in the background
such as saving files as well as for dialogs. If the process has exited such as a make-invocation, the statusbar display
changes back to "Ready" state.</para>

<para>Also, when using the documentation browser <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>documentation browser</primary></indexterm>, the statusbar displays link urls for as long as the cursor is placed over an URL link
in the browser window. Therefore, you can easily find out if the file is a local or a remote file only accessed by network
connection.</para>

<para>The caption of the KDevelop Project Editor shows you the currently opened filename in the top window. This would be a HTML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>HTML</primary></indexterm> file
for the documentation browser <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>documentation browser</primary></indexterm> or a text file for the editing windows. Further, the Project name is displayed, so you have constant

<title>Configuring the HTML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>HTML</primary></indexterm> Browser</title>

<para>The browser included in KDevelop is completely HTML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>HTML</primary></indexterm>-based, therefore you can specify the usual options like background and the
like. You can set all preferences by the "Documentation Browser"-entry of the "Options"-menu.
The configuration dialog <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>configuration dialog</primary></indexterm> shows you two tabulators; the first for setting the font preferences, the second for color selection.</para>

<sect2 id="font-preferences">
<title>Font Preferences</title>

<para>The first option for the font display is the size. Available are small, medium and large. The best display for normal use
is set to small by default.
For the font selection you have to specify a standard font for normal text as it appears in HTML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>HTML</primary></indexterm> documents; the fixed font is the
one used for displaying e.g. code within the HTML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>HTML</primary></indexterm> file.</para>

<sect2 id="color-preferences">
<title>Color Preferences</title>

<para>The color preferences dialog allows configuration of background, normal text, URL Link and followed link color. The
colored buttons on the right are displaying the current settings; selecting a button will result in opening the "Select Color"
dialog. There, you can specify the color either by choosing a System Color, a custom color, select the color by the multi-colored
window or by setting the values directly. The middle contains a preview for the color selected.</para>

<para>Further, you can specify if the browser should underline links to easier detect them visually and if you like to use your own
colors always independent of the page's preset ones. "Apply" will execute all changes, while "OK" will apply changes and close the
dialog. "Cancel" leaves all settings untouched and exits the configuration.</para>

generated automatically, including online-documentation for the KDE-libraries <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-libraries</primary></indexterm> and your project documentation. Plus, the
Documentation Tree in the tree-view lets you customize a special "Others" folder that contains all individually added
documentation.</para>

<sect2 id="requirements">
<title>Requirements</title>

<para>To make use of all features of the Helpbrowser <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Helpbrowser</primary></indexterm>, you should have KDoc <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDoc</primary></indexterm> and glimpse <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>glimpse</primary></indexterm> installed. KDoc <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDoc</primary></indexterm> will generate all kind of online
class-documentation for the KDE-libraries <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-libraries</primary></indexterm> during the setup <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>setup</primary></indexterm> process, but can also invoked by option in the <link linkend="General-Configuration">KDevelop Setup</link>. For the generation of an API <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>API</primary></indexterm> (Application Programming Interface) Documentation for your
project's classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm>, KDoc <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDoc</primary></indexterm> is also used and called by the Project-menu, entry "Make API <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>API</primary></indexterm>-Doc". This will process all current header files
of the project plus the addition of a cross-reference to the Qt and KDE-libraries <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-libraries</primary></indexterm> if those are available in the Helpbrowser <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Helpbrowser</primary></indexterm>. For
the generation of the project handbooks, you should have KSgml2Html <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KSgml2Html</primary></indexterm> (provided with the KDE-SDK <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-SDK</primary></indexterm>) and, as a minimum, SGML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>SGML</primary></indexterm>-tools
installed on your system. To extend and change your project's online-documentation, you have to edit the documentation file for your
project by selecting it in the RFV <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>RFV</primary></indexterm>. After saving your changes, call "Make User-Manual" from the Project-menu. In case SGML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>SGML</primary></indexterm>tools detect
formatting errors <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>errors</primary></indexterm>, those will be displayed in the output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm> window allow you to find the error line directly. The program "glimpse <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>glimpse</primary></indexterm>"
is used to create a personal search-index for your documentation automatically. The index is generally build during the
installation process, but can also be build with the <link linkend="General-Configuration">KDevelop Setup</link> dialog. For a description of
the provided search functions see <link linkend="Using-the-Searchindex">Using the Searchindex</link>.</para>

<sect2 id="provided-documentation">
<title>Provided Documentation</title>

<para>The KDevelop IDE comes with two sets of online-documentation, which can be accessed either via the Help-menu or by the Doc-tree in
the Tree-View in the KDevelop folder. The first book provided is this online-handbook containing all information you need towards
installation, configuration, available functionality and introduction to application development. The second book is <ulink url="programming/index.html">The KDevelop Programming Handbook</ulink> in it's first edition. The programming handbook covers most
questions related to the creation and extension of projects that work with KDevelop. By tutorials the user gets an introduction to the
rich facilities that applications created with the Qt- and/or KDE-libraries <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-libraries</primary></indexterm> have to offer as well as given a guideline for
ensuring KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm>-compliance, which covers the same instructions given on the Internet site at <ulink url="http://developer.kde.org">\|\|</ulink>.
However, the programming handbook cannot replace any additional documentation available in printed or electronic form about the C++
programming language as well as about the usage of the Qt-library in certain terms.</para>

<para>The C/C++-Reference <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Reference</primary></indexterm> used with KDevelop is currently only available on the KDevelop homepage at <ulink url="http://www.kdevelop.org">\|\|</ulink>. On distributions the reference may be included, see your distribution installation program index for
more information. It can be installed easily by downloading and copying the sourcefile to the main KDE-directory ($KDEDIR). There, you
have to untar it as root with <literal remap="tt">tar zxvf c&&lowbar;;c++&&lowbar;;reference.tar.gz</literal>, the reference will then be copied the documentation directory of
KDevelop. For uninstalling the reference documentation you just have to delete the "reference" folder under
($KDEDIR)/share/doc/HTML/default/kdevelop/reference.</para>

<para>The Qt/KDE-libraries <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-libraries</primary></indexterm> documentation folder allows direct access to the HTML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>HTML</primary></indexterm>-online documentation of your copy of the
Qt-library. The path to the library documentation is usually automatically detected by the KDevelop installation program, but can be
set manually in the <link linkend="General-Configuration">KDevelop Setup</link> dialog. Also, all available documentation for the
KDE-libraries <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-libraries</primary></indexterm> are listed in order of the library name, so if you would use classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> of a certain library it is easy to
determine the library type to be added to the Linker <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Linker</primary></indexterm> settings in the project. Mind that the whole KDE-Library documentation is
only accessible when generated by KDoc <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDoc</primary></indexterm>- so this program, included in the KDE-SDK <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-SDK</primary></indexterm>, has to be installed before the
documentation can be generated. As the installation program of KDevelop does this automatically, it should be installed before running
the KDevelop Setup. If this is not the case and the documentation cannot be build, you are able to create it afterwards at any time
with the <link linkend="General-Configuration">KDevelop Setup</link> dialog.</para>

<para>The documentation tree also contains the "Others" folder which is intended to contain all personally customized
documentation as described below. Finally, the Doc-Tree allows access to the API <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>API</primary></indexterm> and the Manual for your current
project.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="adding-documentation-to-the-helpbrowser-help">
<title>Adding Documentation to the Helpbrowser <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Helpbrowser</primary></indexterm></title>

<para>To customize your Helpbrowser <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Helpbrowser</primary></indexterm>, open the Tree-View and select the "DOC <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>DOC</primary></indexterm>" Tabulator. You will see an opened tree containing four folders.
The "Others" folder is, by default, empty. On a right mousebutton click over this folder, a context menu opens that has an entry "Add
Entry". Select this to open the Add Entry dialog where you have to enter two values: the upper one for the name that will be displayed
for the documentation within the Doc-tree, and, below that, a file-entry line. Here, you have to enter the path and filename to the
start page that will be opened by the selection of the entry later. You can enter the path and filename directly or by selection of the
pushbutton on the right to open a file-chooser dialog. This allows a quick browsing on your system to the path for your start page. Mind
that only HTML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>HTML</primary></indexterm>-documentation can be selected, so only HTML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>HTML</primary></indexterm> files are allowed to choose. Selecting OK will add the entry to the Doc-tree
and is available directly.</para>

<sect2 id="using-the-searchindex">
<title>Using the Searchindex</title>

<para>KDevelop includes a set of functions to help you search information within HTML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>HTML</primary></indexterm> documentation. To use these features, your system
needs to have the program "glimpse <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>glimpse</primary></indexterm>", a free database generator, installed, which creates the search index <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>search index</primary></indexterm> and executes searches
within the documentation. To set up the index, see <link linkend="General-Configuration">KDevelop Setup</link>. The index is also
automatically generated during the installation program.</para>

<para>The search functions are available through several ways which you can choose from:
<orderedlist><listitem>
<para>in the editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>editor</primary></indexterm>, select the text you want to have help on or place the cursor in the word that you want to look for. Then
press the right mouse button and select look up: "expression" This can also be done by selecting "Search Marked Text" from the
Help-menu, the shortcut key F2 or by selecting the Search icon from the toolbar.</para>
</listitem>

<para>if you want to search for a specific keyword, select "Search for Help on..." in the Help-menu or select the "Search for Help
on..." icon from the toolbar, opening a search dialog where you can enter the expression you want to get information for.</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

Direct access to specific documentation is given by selecting the according icon in the "DOC <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>DOC</primary></indexterm>" -tree-view or by the Help-menu
entries.</para>

<para>The Helpbrowser <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Helpbrowser</primary></indexterm> also offers support for grep <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>grep</primary></indexterm> to search for a selection within your current project, e.g you've opened the documentation
page for the <literal remap="tt">KTMainWindow</literal> class (KDEUI library) and you want to know where in your code <literal remap="tt">KTMainWindow</literal> appears. Mark
<literal remap="tt">KTMainWindow</literal> and either select "Grep: KTMainWindow" or press Shift+F2. The "Search in Files" dialog opens with the results about
your grep <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>grep</primary></indexterm> search directly. Then you can choose an result line to jump to the according sourcecode.</para>

<chapter id="working-with-the-editor">
<title>Working with the Editor</title>

<para>An important part of the integrated development environment is the editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>editor</primary></indexterm>. You're using it for:

Generally, the editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>editor</primary></indexterm> itself doesn't do much difference in comparison to other editors; especially as it is a build-in version of
the popular KWrite, also known as the "Extended Editor". If you're familiar with that, you won't have any problems using it for
managing your projects. In addition to normal editors, KDevelop contains a new printing <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>printing</primary></indexterm> system, that is far more extended for use
with sourcecodes- and you can choose between the printing <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>printing</primary></indexterm> program you want to use.</para>

<para>This section gives you more information about how to handle your project files <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>project files</primary></indexterm> and to make you more familiar with the editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>editor</primary></indexterm>'s
functionality. A lot of Unix-hardliners would prefer using Emacs or XEmacs- they're fine with that. But it isn't necessary for
easy programming, and especially for beginners, to work themselves into powerful editors which shall, in the result, only allow
you to enter your code.</para>

<sect1 id="managing-project-files">
<title>Managing Project Files</title>

<para>The following sections describe how to create, save, open and close your project files <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>project files</primary></indexterm> you need to edit- mind that this doesn't
include translation files or pixmaps <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>pixmaps</primary></indexterm>. Those are recognized automatically and the according editing program like KTranslator <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KTranslator</primary></indexterm> opens
those files for you.</para>

<para>To give you an easy access to your files, KDevelop contains two easy-to-handle tree-views, similar to a filemanager, that recognize
if you selected a file, and opens it in the according editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>editor</primary></indexterm> window. The main view contains two windows that are used
independently, but connected via the Project Editor, so you can do all menubar actions the same way. The intention behind this is
that it allows you to handle two windows at the same time, although only one is visible. The C/C++ window thereby takes another
task, which allows you to easily compile your sources one by one, so you can check the implementations without having to run a
complete build-process over your project.</para>

<para>This can be done when having the C/C++ window on top. Select "Compile File <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compile File</primary></indexterm>" from the Build-menu or press the according button in
the toolbar. Your file gets saved and compiled, and you can control any errors <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>errors</primary></indexterm> by the Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm> in the output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm> window.</para>

<para>Within the IDE you can open as many text files as you like. All opened files are listed in the Window-menu, so you can switch
between them by selecting the according filename from the menu. Further, the actual opened file is displayed with its name in the
window frame of KDevelop.</para>

<sect2 id="creating-and-saving-files">
<title>Creating and Saving Files</title>

<para>To create a new file, choose "New" from the File-menu. This opens the "New File <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>New File</primary></indexterm>" dialog, where you can specify the filename and type.
Additionally, you have to set the destination directory as well if the file is added to the project or not. Finally, you can also use
your header template for the project in case you want to add a new sourcefile without generating a new class by the Class-Generator.</para>

<para>After the file has been created, you can edit the new file as usual; if you have to switch between different files, you can always
turn back to the file either via the file-trees or by the Window-menu.</para>

<para>For saving any changes, KDevelop offers a whole variety of options. The standard way would be to save the file by selecting "Save"
or "Save As" from the File-menu or by the Save-button on the toolbar. For saving all changed files at once, you could as well
select "Save all" from the File-menu.</para>

<para>Now, when working on a project, it is very annoying if something critical happens while you have done a lot of changes on your
files; sometimes you will bite yourself that you have forgotten to save the changes. KDevelop takes care of this by offering
"Autosaving", which is by default enabled and set to save all files in intervals of 5 minutes. To select another saving period or
to disable this, see <link linkend="KDevelop-Setup">KDevelop Setup</link>, where the setup <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>setup</primary></indexterm> options are described.</para>

<para>Additionally, KDevelop takes care for all changes if you open another project or exit KDevelop. You will be asked for saving the
changed files, where you also have the option to specify which one to save and which you want to stay unsaved. Further, when
invoking any build-processes, your files get saved automatically, so you won't ever wonder why your application doesn't run the
way you expected it to do after your changes to the source files. The only exception is the "Compile File <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compile File</primary></indexterm>" command, which only
saves the currently opened source file visible in the source editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>editor</primary></indexterm> window.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="opening-and-closing-files">
<title>Opening and Closing Files</title>

<para>To open a source file, you have a lot of options as well. One way could be, as the standard for editors, to select "Open" from the
File-menu. You will be presented an "Open File" dialog, which allows you to choose the file you want to edit. Another, probably
more frequently used way is to select the file from the LFV <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>LFV</primary></indexterm>, the Logical File Viewer, or the RFV <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>RFV</primary></indexterm>, the Real File Viewer (see <link linkend="Overview">\|\|</link>). The advantage of the file trees is that they provide a quick visual access to your files, especially the LFV <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>LFV</primary></indexterm>,
which only displays your project files <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>project files</primary></indexterm> by their type, collected into folders. You can as well configure the LFV <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>LFV</primary></indexterm> towards sorting
your files in another manner by a right mouse click on the tree. Select "New Group" from the popup-menu, and you can configure a
new group, or select "Edit Group" to install new file filters by specifying the group's file extensions, separated by commas.</para>

<para>The standard file groups for a project generated by KAppWizard <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KAppWizard</primary></indexterm> are the Headers, Sources, GNU and Others. Additionally, after
adding a translation file, KDevelop adds a folder "Translations", containing your *.po files.</para>

<para>To close files, select the file to close from the Window-menu, which loads the opened file into the front editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>editor</primary></indexterm>. Then select
"Close" from the File-menu. If your file has been changed, you will be asked to save it. When closing a project, all currently
opened files will be checked for changes and you will be asked for saving as well.</para>

<para>The syntax-highlighting mode of KDevelop's editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>editor</primary></indexterm> can be configured by two dialogs; first you can set default colors for
syntax-highlighting by the "Editor Defaults" entry in the "Options"-menu. There, you can set colors and fonts as well as the
fontsize for e.g. keywords. Select the default item and set all needed options.</para>

<para>The second configuration dialog <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>configuration dialog</primary></indexterm> is accessed by the "Syntax-Highlighting" entry in the "Options"-menu. This allows you to set the
file filters for the programming language, e.g. *.cpp, *.h  for C++. Then select the item that you want to configure. If you wish
to use the default values you've set in the "Editor Defaults" dialog, select the "default" checkboxes in the Item-style and
Item-Font sections. This reads the default settings for the selected item. After pressing OK, your new values will be enabled and
used by the editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>editor</primary></indexterm>.</para>

<sect2 id="searching-over-several-files">
<title>Searching over Several Files</title>

<para>As the search function only is referencing searches over a single file that is currently visible, you're limited to this. But often
you want to search for the same expression overall your project. Therefore, KDevelop contains a <literal remap="tt">grep <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>grep</primary></indexterm></literal>-dialog, which
lets you search over all files that you specify either by setting the directory to start the search from and/or by mime-type.
Specifying the exact directory and the mime-type will therefore reduce the time that KDevelop needs to read your files and display
the results. To start a search over several files, select "Search in files..." from the "Edit"-menu. The search dialog opens and
lets you enter:</para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>The expression to search for (the pattern)</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The template used for the search</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The mime-type of files to search in</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The directory to start form</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If the search is recursive over all included subdirectories</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>By default, the grep <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>grep</primary></indexterm>-dialog is set to start at your project directory and works recursively over implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm> and header files.</para>

<para>You can even extend your search pattern by using the following options:</para>

<para><orderedlist><listitem>
<para><emphasis remap="bf">.</emphasis> Match any character</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis remap="bf">&&circ;;</emphasis> Match the beginning of a line</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis remap="bf">$</emphasis> Match the end of a line</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis remap="bf">\&lt; </emphasis> Match the beginning of a word</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis remap="bf">\&gt; </emphasis> Match the end of a word</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<para>For a repeating search, you can also use the available operators:
<orderedlist><listitem>
<para><emphasis remap="bf">?</emphasis> The preceding item matches less than once</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis remap="bf">*</emphasis> The preceding item is matched zero or more times</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis remap="bf">+</emphasis> The preceding item is matched once or more times</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis remap="bf">&&lcub;; n &&rcub;;</emphasis> The preceding item is matched exactly <emphasis>n</emphasis> times</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis remap="bf">&&lcub;; n,&&rcub;;</emphasis> The preceding item is matched <emphasis>n</emphasis> or more times</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis remap="bf">&&lcub;;,n &&rcub;;</emphasis> The preceding item matches less than <emphasis>n</emphasis> times</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis remap="bf">&&lcub;;n,m&&rcub;;</emphasis> The preceding item matches at least <emphasis>n</emphasis> times but less than <emphasis>m</emphasis> times</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<para>Backreferences to bracketed subexpressions are also available by the notation <emphasis>\n</emphasis>.</para>

<para>After specifying your search, press "Search". The results are then displayed in the result-window. To jump to a file and line
number, select the resultline and press Enter or double click the result. The editor will automatically open the according file
and place the cursor to the line of the result. This allows a complete specification for any search action and give out exact
results.</para>

<para>KDevelop offers also some more specialized functionality to use grep <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>grep</primary></indexterm> within the editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>editor</primary></indexterm>s and the browser. Select the expression you want
to search for in either of the windows and press SHIFT+F2 or select "grep <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>grep</primary></indexterm>:&&lt;;your&&lowbar;;expression&&gt;;" from the right button popup menu.
This will ask grep <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>grep</primary></indexterm> to search for the selection in your project directory's files and will show the results immediately. Switching to
the result works as described above. From within the editor window, it lasts to place the cursor over a word and start searching; the
word under the cursor will be the search pattern.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="searching-within-documentation">
<title>Searching within Documentation</title>

<para>While working on a project, you often need to have information about the parameters of member functions <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>member functions</primary></indexterm> you want to use- most
often you remember the function's name that matches your needs, but the parameters are a very hard thing to keep in mind.
Therefore, and for other purposes that may occur, KDevelop contains a search functionality that combines searching expressions
that appear in your files with the documentation browser <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>documentation browser</primary></indexterm>. To make use of this search functionality, you should have set up the
documentation browser <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>documentation browser</primary></indexterm> correctly and created the search database. For invoking a search through the documentation, do the
following:</para>

<para><orderedlist><listitem>
<para>place your cursor at the word you want to search or mark an expression</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>select "Search Marked Text" from the Help-menu <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Help-menu</primary></indexterm> or press the right mouse button to open the context menu; then select
"Look Up: "expression".</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>after the search result <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>search result</primary></indexterm> page is displayed in the documentation browser <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>documentation browser</primary></indexterm>, select the page that you think could contain the
information you need.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>the selected documentation page is displayed and your search result <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>search result</primary></indexterm> is marked. To display the next result within the same
documentation page, press F3.</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<para>This allows you to easily find the information you need. For using the results, the documentation browser <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>documentation browser</primary></indexterm> allows marking a
selection and copying it to the clipboard. Then return to the file you're editing and select "Paste" from the "Edit"-menu.</para>

<sect2 id="replacing-text">
<title>Replacing Text</title>

<para>For replacing an expression, select "Search and Replace" from the "Edit"-menu. The "Search and Replace"-dialog lets you specify
the expression to be replaced as well as the replacement expression. Then press OK. The first expression which is found will be
marked, so you can see where the expression is and in which context. Then you can specify by a dialog if the expression shall be
replaced or not. When the search is finished by reaching the end of the current file, you will be asked if you want to start the
search again from the beginning. If you're finished, select "Cancel".</para>

<sect1 id="printing">
<title>Printing</title>

<para>As KDevelop is designed to give developers the best access to files and information to reduce development cycles, it also contains
a new printing utility which makes use of <emphasis>enscript</emphasis>, a common printing program available for Unix-Systems. 
Besides, you can also print by directly using lpr (the lineprinter device). As using enscript offers the
most options towards printing, you should install it on your system; it is usually shipped with
distributions, so you shouldn't have any problem to get it. But before printing, you should have a look at the available
configuration dialog to prepare the output according to your needs. The following section describes how to configure KDevelop for
printing files.</para>

<para>KDevelop creates a projectfile with the .kdevprj ending. This file contains all your project information, so be careful not to
delete it. It is stored in the project's base directory and has to be opened to load the project. The projectfile keeps all
information for your files like the file properties, install path, distribution status and compiler options <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>compiler options</primary></indexterm> (CXXFLAGS). Setting
file properties allows you to keep track of where the files should go.</para>

<para>With KAppWizard <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KAppWizard</primary></indexterm>, you can create a new application project according to your choice of application type. For now, KAppWizard <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KAppWizard</primary></indexterm>
generates four kinds of frame applications, as:</para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>a single document interface (SDI) KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm>-application including a menubar, a toolbar and a statusbar. It contains basic control
resource management to allow extending the frame application into a unique KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> application. The application frame also
contains statusbar help messages as known from commercial products just like KDevelop itself. From the programmer's point of view,
it is based on three application-specific classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> leaning on the MVC-concept (Model-View-Controller). Technically, the base
classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> may not be viewed that way, but it's construction is at least created most logical to create applications with a GUI <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>GUI</primary></indexterm>.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>a KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm>-based application frame window. This application type offers most flexibility to those wanting to develop their
program from scratch, but can also be used as a basis for developing wizard applications or modules.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>a Qt-only based program framework. For those programmers who want to use the Qt-library <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Qt-library</primary></indexterm> as the GUI <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>GUI</primary></indexterm> interface alone, we
tried to offer you a smart framework to support your application development. As Qt programming is fully supported, you should
have no problems to create a full-functional application by using Qt only.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>a C++ program framework. This application type is intended for those wanting to write a terminal based C++ program. Just
remove the "Hello World" line in main() and construct your classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> the same way with KDevelop as for KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> applications.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>a C program framework for C programmers. This is as well a terminal based application but only uses the C compiler.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>Further, KDevelop allows you to create projects for KDE 2 and Qt 2.x. These projects require installing the 
required libraries as well as setting the according installation path in the KDevelop Setup dialog (see <link linkend="General-Configuration">General Configuration</link>) before generating a project to ensure everything 
will work automatically. The KDevelop 1.2 Appwizard adds a GNOME-template so that developers wanting to use KDevelop to create
GTK+-based applications can do so as well.</para>

<para>Additionally, KDevelop enables you to work with already existing projects. Those can have any options set by the programmer himself by
configure and Makefiles. As far as the execution and the build-process is concerned, the current state only allows the same structure
as for the other baseclasses. Create a custom project with the application wizard and add your files to the project to allow scanning
by the classbrowser.</para>

<para>To ensure the build process, your custom project has to have all sources in a subdirectory matching the lowercase name of your project;
the execution of the binary is also restricted to this lowercase project name.</para>

<para>Mind that KDevelop does not write any information into Makefiles or configuration files. You are responsible for any project behavior
and build settings yourself.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="libraries">
<title>Libraries</title>

<para>A general project-type to create libraries is not available at the moment. Anyway, building libraries is not impossible with KDevelop.
Here are a few guidelines and workarounds:</para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Whenever your project subdirectory gets another subdirectory that contains source files, KDevelop will build a static library of
these. That means static libraries are already supported by automatic creation in order to sort project sourcefiles.
Mind that the static library is part of the binary later and won't get installed.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>to create a shared library KDevelop offers an easy way to turn a such created static library into a shared: Open the RFV on the
left of KDevelops main window and browse to the created subdirectory. There, use the right mouse button over the subdirectory. The
popup-menu offers the following options:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>update Makefile.am</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>change to static lib</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>change to shared lib</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

Use "change to shared lib" to convert the default generated static library into a shared one. You can reverse your decision later if
you decide that using it as a static library will work as well for your project- just do the same steps again and select "change to
static lib".</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="multiple-targets">
<title>Multiple Targets</title>

<para>For some projects, the facilities of KDevelop at it's current state will not last. Those are projects that include multiple
targets like packages containing several applications. As commands like "Execute" require that only one target is build by the
developer, those types of projects are only supported in the way that you have to write your own entries to the Makefile.am <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile.am</primary></indexterm>'s and
creating your directories for the additional libraries or binaries to build. Nevertheless, a build-process always invokes your
make-program independent from what actually the targets are; so these functions still can be used (with the restriction that the build
is invoked from the main project subdirectory).</para>

<para>Another way to still work with this type and to still have access to the binaries themselves are creating empty projects and move their
subdirectories in conjunction with the project files <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>project files</primary></indexterm> to the directory containing all sources later. Then you could load each
target independently by its project file; this also allows executing and debugging <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>debugging</primary></indexterm> the target.</para>

<para>Multiple binaries or libraries within the main project subdirectory are possible with following the rules explained in section <link linkend="Project-Hacking">Project Hacking</link> and the following guidelines for editing the main project's subdirectory Makefile.am (all
modifications outside the KDevelop write area):</para>

<sect1 id="new-project-new-projects">
<title>New Project <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>New Project</primary></indexterm>s</title>

<para>The KDevelop Application Wizard allows the creation of different types of projects, constructing a framework for each. All
projects use the GNU standard development tools as described in the requirements section of this handbook.</para>

<para>For KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> applications there are six different frameworks:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Mini: Creates a KDE-application with an empty main widget.</para>

</para>

<para>If you wish no dependencies towards the KDE-libraries <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-libraries</primary></indexterm> for end-users, you can choose from four Qt-only types:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Normal: Creates a Qt-Application with a main window containing a menubar, toolbar and statusbar, including support for a generic 
document-view model.</para>
</listitem>

document interface (MDI) model.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>QextMDI: Creates an MDI framework based on the QextMDI library and Qt2.0x. Allows to switch between both modes, Toplevel and Childframe.

<para>Further, the Application Wizard offers a template for creating GNOME-compliant applications with the GTK+ C-library with a ready-to-run
mainwindow containing a menubar, toolbar and statusbar.</para>

<para>The two C and C++ -Application types offer a framework for creating commandline applications.</para>

<para>And last but not least you can create an empty projekt, e.g. to work with existing projects.</para>

<para>The wizard asks for your project name, version and the location where the project directory will be build.  Further, your Name and
Email address are asked for inserting them in header and cpp templates on top of your source files as well as for entries in the
*.lsm file.</para>

<para>For adding revision control to your project, see <link linkend="CVS-Integration">CVS Integration</link>.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="opening-and-closing-of-projects">
<title>Opening and Closing of Projects</title>

<para>KDevelop is by default configured to open the last project loaded when starting. This allows a fast start, but you may want to
change that to just start the IDE without any project. To prevent the default behavior, disable the "Load last project" option in
the <link linkend="KDevelop-Setup">KDevelop Setup</link> dialog.</para>

<para>To open another project, select "Open" from the "Project" menu or press the "Open Project" button on the toolbar. In case you've
got another project currently open, this will be closed. If your current project then contains files that aren't saved, you are
asked to save all changed files. Thereby, you can select which file to save and which you want to close without saving, or to save
all at once.</para>

<para>Then you get an "Open Project" dialog, where you can change to the directory containing the project file to be loaded. KDevelop
project files <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>project files</primary></indexterm> have the <emphasis>*.kdevprj</emphasis> mime-type which is also displayed by a project icon. Select the project file and press
"Open". When loading a project, the Class Browser scans all files and builds the initial classtree, so you can start working on the
project by using the Class Browser directly.</para>

<para>Another comfortable way to open a project is to select the project file in the KFM, the KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> File Manager. This will start
KDevelop with loading the selected project file. You could as well open a project by commandline, entering <literal remap="tt">kdevelop
projectname.kdevprj</literal>.</para>

<para>When closing KDevelop, your project file will be saved automatically and the IDE detects if you have changed any project files.
Then you will be asked to save any changes before exiting. The available options for closing are the same than for closing a
project before loading another.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="editing-a-project">
<title>Editing a Project</title>

<para>After you created a new project with the KAppWizard <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KAppWizard</primary></indexterm>, the usual task is to extend the project by editing the already created
sources and adding classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm>, pixmaps <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>pixmaps</primary></indexterm>, pictures and whatelse you project needs. Now, editing a project means that you can change the
default project after its generation by menus and dialogs according to your needs. The next section therefore describes how you
can add existing files and classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> as well as creating new files. This is needed for building your project, but this won't help
you for the installation process by the end-user. Therefore, section <link linkend="Setting-Project-File-Options">Setting Project File Options</link> describes how to set File Properties especially for additional files that you want make to install, like documentation or
pixmaps <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>pixmaps</primary></indexterm>.
Another part in project maintaining is adding translations for applications that support internationalization, which is described
in <link linkend="Adding-Translations">Adding Translations</link>.</para>

<para><link linkend="Extending-the-Project-Documentation">Extending the Project Documentation</link> covers questions on how to create a good set
of documentation for online help enabling the end-user to help himself in case of troubles as well as how to use your product.</para>

<para>Finally, <link linkend="Project-Hacking">Project Hacking</link> describes how you can eventually work around the KDevelop project
management in special cases.</para>

<sect2 id="adding-files-and-classes">
<title>Adding and Removing Files and Classes</title>

<para>Adding a new file is often used when you think that you should separate your class implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm> file into several ones. Then you
need to create an new file which will contain the part of the class implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm> you want to move. You can do this by choosing
"New" from the "File"-menu <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>"File"-menu</primary></indexterm>, opening the "New File <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>New File</primary></indexterm>" dialog. This enables you to specify the file-type, name and the
location. When entering the filename, KDevelop automatically enters the extension for you, but you can as well change the extensions
towards your own preferences. Further, you can include the header template for sourcefiles, so you don't have to copy this into your
new file yourself. Also, you can decide, if the file is included in the project or not. Mind that this doesn't cover the installation
destination; this has to be configured later by setting the file preferences.</para>

<para>After the new file has been created, the project file will be updated as well as the according Makefile.am <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile.am</primary></indexterm>'s.
To add a complete class to your project, you can construct a new class with the Classgenerator which is invoked by "New Class <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>New Class</primary></indexterm>" from
the Project-menu.</para>

<para>In case you have an existing project and you want to add certain classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> that you want to re-use in your project, select "Add
File(s) to Project..." from the "Project"-menu <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>"Project"-menu</primary></indexterm>. Select "Add existing files", which will open a dialog to let you specify which
files will be added to the project and the destination directory. Mind that the files will be copied into the specified directory and
added to the project. You should call "Make" after adding sources; then your added files will be included in the build-process. In
case you want to add e.g. pixmaps <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>pixmaps</primary></indexterm> that have to be installed by the end-user, you should update the File Properties for the added
file and specify the installation path (see <link linkend="Setting-Project-File-Options">Setting Project File Options</link></para>

<para>To add a file to the project that is already in the project directory, go to the RFV <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>RFV</primary></indexterm>, where all project-included files are
displayed by their project status by a red ! over the file icon. Select the file you want to add to the project (which has a normal
file icon) and press the right mouse button to get the popup-menu. Then select "Add".</para>

<para>Files can also be removed from your project. This could be needed in cases where you don't want to use pre-generated files that
are already given by the KAppWizard <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KAppWizard</primary></indexterm>. To remove a file, you have additionally the option between removing a file from the project
or delete it completely. To remove a file from the project, select the file in the LFV <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>LFV</primary></indexterm> or the RFV <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>RFV</primary></indexterm>, press the right mouse button
and select "remove". To delete a file, select "delete physically".</para>

<sect2 id="setting-project-file-options">
<title>Setting Project File Options</title>

<para>The file properties dialog can be accessed via the project menu or within the LFV <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>LFV</primary></indexterm> by a right mouseclick.  It shows the project
files in groups as they are sorted in the LFV <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>LFV</primary></indexterm> and displays the file properties like file size, file type and if the file is
included in the project as well as the installation path if the file is going to be installed by the end-user's make install
command.  It is important for documentation files as well as pixmaps <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>pixmaps</primary></indexterm> to specify the location where the files should go when the
project is build and installed by end users, so you have to set up those locations. For standard KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> location macros you should
look in your Makefile.am <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile.am</primary></indexterm> where the location macros are specified.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="adding-translations">
<title>Adding Translations</title>

<para>As KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> allows configuring your desktop and the behavior of your applications, you also have the option to choose the language
that your application uses, in regards of the use of online-documentation as well as the application's look. For documentation files,
this seems a trivial task. You would add a subdirectory labeled by the desired language, e.g. <literal remap="tt">de</literal> for German, to the
<literal remap="tt">docs</literal> directory of your project and copy the english documentation into that directory. Then you would generate the
documentation and set all project file options for the installation directories. Then you could start translating the SGML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>SGML</primary></indexterm> file to
your desired language and regenerate the documentation; then you're done.
For the application, this seems a bit more difficult for the programmer. Now, we want to explain how to enable
internationalization support for your application and how to add the languages you want to support.</para>

<para>First, you have to enclose all visible strings of your application that appear in bars or dialogs with the <literal remap="tt">i18n <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>i18n</primary></indexterm>()</literal> macro.
This macro is a replacement for the function <literal remap="tt">klocale-&gt;translate()</literal> of the KLocale class and much easier to use. As this macro
is declared in the <literal remap="tt">kapp.h</literal> include file, you have to add <literal remap="tt">&&num;;include &&lt;;kapp.h&&gt;;</literal> to the source file or the class
declaration <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>declaration</primary></indexterm> file of the class that makes use of the macro. Also it should be mentioned, that although <literal remap="tt">i18n <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>i18n</primary></indexterm>()</literal> is a macro and
therefore you could think about using the original function, this won't work because the strings that are set up for translation
have to be read out of the sources and get stored in the application's translation file (&&lt;;YourApp&&gt;;.pot in the /po
subdirectory). This task is done by the program xgettext, and to do this, you would enter <literal remap="tt">make messages <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>messages</primary></indexterm></literal> in your project
directory containing the sources. As xgettext depends on the <literal remap="tt">i18n <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>i18n</primary></indexterm>()</literal> macro, the original function won't do the job.</para>

<para>For translations themselves, you first have to create the message file containing all strings that are used in your sources with
the <literal remap="tt">i18n <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>i18n</primary></indexterm>()</literal> macro. This can be done by choosing "Make messages <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>messages</primary></indexterm> and merge" from the Build-menu.
Then you have to add the languages that your application wants to support. Therefore, select "Add Translation File" from the
Project-menu. This opens a language selection dialog. Select the language and press OK. This will build the ASCII file containing
entries for the filename of the string and the line where the original string is placed. Then you will see a <literal remap="tt">msgid</literal> line
containing the string to translate, followed by <literal remap="tt">msgstr</literal>. The msgstr line is mostly empty except for the translations already
provided by the KDE-libraries <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-libraries</primary></indexterm>. Those have to be filled with the according translations of your language.</para>

<para>You could think about writing the translations by hand, which can also be done. But the KDE-SDK <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-SDK</primary></indexterm> offers the use of the program

translated strings to support your language.</para>

<para>To access KTranslator <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KTranslator</primary></indexterm>, the easiest way is selecting a &&lt;;language&&gt;;.po file in the /po directory either in the LFV <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>LFV</primary></indexterm> or in the
RFV <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>RFV</primary></indexterm>. This opens KTranslator <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KTranslator</primary></indexterm> and lets you do the translating easily. Mind that you have to set up KTranslator <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KTranslator</primary></indexterm>'s properties
yourself to include the author name and the language as well as the destination file. KTranslator <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KTranslator</primary></indexterm> by default only opens your
translation file.</para>

<para>For all translation files, <literal remap="tt">make <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>make</primary></indexterm></literal> uses the program <literal remap="tt">msgfmt</literal> to format your message files to use with the binary, but you
don't have to take care for that, as well as specifying the destination directory for installing the translation files; this is
all done by KDevelop automatically.</para>

<para>For more information about internationalization support, see <ulink url="http://www.kde.org">\|\|</ulink>; a lot of people are doing translations for
you to support their language. You will find a list of email-addresses of the translators you could write to and who will help you with
this. Also read <link linkend="The-Dialog-Editor">The Dialog Editor</link> and <ulink url="programming/index-11.html">The KDevelop Programming Handbook</ulink> where questions about internationalization are covered again.</para>

<sect2 id="extending-the-project-documentation">
<title>Extending the Project Documentation</title>

<para>All projects created with KDevelop contain a pre-configured documentation, which already contains standard chapters for
installation, project name and version as well as the author name and email-address. As KDevelop uses SGML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>SGML</primary></indexterm>-templates, it's very
easy to extend the documentation to a full descriptive helpsystem. The only thing you have to do is editing the SGML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>SGML</primary></indexterm> file, placed
in docs/en as index.sgml. The reference documentation included with your sgml-tools package can be added to the Helpbrowser <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Helpbrowser</primary></indexterm> and
allow you direct access to special tags as well as a short description of how to extend the documentation. SGML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>SGML</primary></indexterm> has a lot of
advantages, whereas KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> makes wide use by this documentation type with the additional KSgml2Html <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KSgml2Html</primary></indexterm> tool. This creates the typical
KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm>-style documentation and makes it look nicer. Anyway, the sgmltools alone are enough to produce a html output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm> that is already
included in your application. To create the documents using KSgml2Html <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KSgml2Html</primary></indexterm>, install the tool and run "Make User-Manual" from the
Build-menu. The Documentation Browser allows a direct controlling of the output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm> by selecting "Project User-Manual" from the
Help-menu or the according icon in the DOC <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>DOC</primary></indexterm>-tree. Then you can browse the documentation online in KDevelop and have a better
overview by the output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm> over errors <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>errors</primary></indexterm> that result in missing tags.</para>

<para>Now, while extending the documentation, you can't avoid that additional files are produced that have to be included into the
project as each <literal remap="tt">sect</literal>-tag creates a new HTML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>HTML</primary></indexterm> file. The output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm> generated by the KAppWizard <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KAppWizard</primary></indexterm> is already included in the project,
so you don't have to care for their installation path. What you have to watch out for is any index-xx.html file, where xx is
higher than 6 (as the first six pages are already included in the project). After generating the documentation, switch to the RFV <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>RFV</primary></indexterm>
and browse to your documentation directory. Press the right mouse button over the files to add and select "Add". Further,
KSgml2Html <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KSgml2Html</primary></indexterm> adds the KDE <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE</primary></indexterm> logo to the documentation directory. This file, <literal remap="tt">logotp3.gif</literal>, has to be added to the project as well.
Then you have to select the "File Properties" either from the Project menu or by the popup menu in the file-viewers. The easiest
way to set the installation path is to select a documentation file already set up for installation such as <literal remap="tt">index.html</literal>. You
see that <literal remap="tt">Install</literal> is checked and the Installdir+filename already contains the destination. Mark the Installdir and enter
CTRL+C to copy the installation path to the clipboard. Then select the file you want to specify for installation. Enable
<literal remap="tt">Install</literal>, this will enable the installdir-entry field, already containing the filename. Place the cursor in front of the
filename and enter CTRL+V to insert the clipboard contents (which was the installation path copied before). This is the fastest
way to specify the installation path. For more options about specifying installation destinations, see <ulink url="programming/index-14.html">The KDevelop Programming Handbook</ulink>.</para>

<title>Project Hacking</title>

<para>When working with a project, you should never edit the project file by hand. This will prevent KDevelop from loading your project
correctly under certain circumstances, as well as changes will not result in updating the Makefile <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile</primary></indexterm>s. To change any settings for
your project, you have to use the given menu entries like e.g. for adding files or setting file properties. For experts that are
not comfortable with certain options for e.g. the Linker <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Linker</primary></indexterm> or need additional project configuration, you should work yourself into
the Makefile.am <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile.am</primary></indexterm> macros and add all changes in the Makefile.am <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Makefile.am</primary></indexterm>'s after the section separated with the entry "KDevelop write area".
As the GNU-tools are using the commands at the end of all macro files, you can overwrite KDevelop's settings with this. Mind that
this will prevent using KDevelop for any changes related to project configuration.</para>

<para>Each new project contains all needed options for the Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> and Linker <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Linker</primary></indexterm> as well as general settings. By default, your project
is set to use debugging <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>debugging</primary></indexterm> by the -g flag, and warnings <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>warnings</primary></indexterm> are set to the standard, -Wall. This ensures you can debug your application
and detect constructions that may cause program errors <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>errors</primary></indexterm>. For some applications, you would need additional Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> or Linker <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Linker</primary></indexterm> flags,
especially if you're using libraries that are not currently included by the Linker <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Linker</primary></indexterm>. Then you need to update the project by
configuring the correct settings with the Project Options dialog. See <link linkend="Build-Settings">Build Settings</link> for more

<sect2 id="target">
<title>Target</title>

<para>The target box contains two options that can be set:</para>

<para>Target Machine: You have the choice to set the target machine option here by choosing between your machine (default) and i386v,
which is the option if you configure <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>configure</primary></indexterm>d your Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> as a cross-compiler for an Intel 386-compatible machine running System V. This
option sets the -b flag to the Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm>. Usually you would leave this to the default.</para>

<para>Optimize: You can enable optimization for your build process by this option, meaning to set the -O flag. If not checked, the flag
is set to -O0, so no optimization will be used. If you enable optimization by checking this option, you can as well specify the
optimization level below from 1 to 3.</para>

<para>For a release version of your application, enable optimization and set the level to 2.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="debugging-1">
<title>Debugging</title>

<para>Right of the Target box, you can see the debugging <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>debugging</primary></indexterm>-section. This means that you can set your Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> to include information for
debuggers within the final binary, so the programmer can follow the execution of the application with the debugger in direct
context to the sourcecode.</para>

<para>Enable debugging <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>debugging</primary></indexterm> therefore sets the -g flag; the debugging <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>debugging</primary></indexterm> level specifies the amount of information to be included in the binary.
Available are level 1 to 3 to choose from. Mind that the binary execution will be slower by setting any debugging <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>debugging</primary></indexterm> option and that
the binary size will increase by the debugging <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>debugging</primary></indexterm> level.</para>

<para>Generate extra information for gprof: sets the -pg flag, resulting that the Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm> will include information for the gprof
program that displays caller graphs of your program's function.</para>

<para>Store temporary intermediate files: sets the -save-temps flag. This will result in storing the usually temporary files produced by
the preprocessor and the assembler. A compilation of a sourcefile will therefore produce three output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm> files: an *.o file which is
the final output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm> of the Compiler <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Compiler</primary></indexterm>, an *.i file produced by the preprocessor and an *.s file as the output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm> of the assembler.</para>

<title>The Classviewer</title>

<para><indexterm><primary>classbrowser</primary></indexterm>
The KDevelop Classviewer is one of the most useful and important tools that the IDE provides a developer for managing his project
sources. When a project is loaded, a class parser reads all project sources for functions, classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> etc., then displays the results in
the CV <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>CV</primary></indexterm> treeview. This chapter shows you how to use the Classviewer and the provided functionality and how it can improve your work.</para>

<para>Classes and their methods can also be accessed by the browser toolbar. There, the left combo selects the class; the right
lets you choose the methods of the selected class. When you select a method, the classbrowser will automatically bring you to the
implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm> file and sets the cursor to the method. Finally, the class-assistant button on the right of the method combo will bring
you to the declaration <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>declaration</primary></indexterm> of the method on a click; on another click to the definition. The delayed popup menu, displayed by the
down-arrow on the button, offers additional functionality that is also available in the classviewer's context menus, such as:</para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Goto Declaration: browses to the declaration <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>declaration</primary></indexterm> of the method</para>

<sect2 id="available-objects">
<title>Available Objects</title>

<para>By available objects, we describe a term that means that C++ code can be seen as a collection of objects- classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm>, their members,
global functions and the like. The classtree displays these objects logically and orders them by character, so they are easy to locate
in the tree as well by their according icon. Therefore the classtree contains a "Classes" and a "Globals" folder. Thereby the "Classes"
folder generally contains the project's classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm>; if your project contains subfolders to manage your sourcefiles, these are also
displayed by their original folder name and contain all classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> that are stored in the files located in the subfolder.</para>

<para>Further, when popping up a class, the classtree displays the class contents by separating methods and attributes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>attributes</primary></indexterm>. As these can have
attributes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>attributes</primary></indexterm> as well like public, private and protected, these are displayed by modified icons as well. You see that a class displayed in
the Class Browser contains all the objects that are present in the class declaration <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>declaration</primary></indexterm>.</para>

<para>Now, classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> are a very common thing when programming in C++ and will contain most of the code. But applications also contain objects
that have a "Global" appearance to the program. These would be structs, functions etc. Especially the <literal remap="tt">main()</literal> function appears in
every application and you need to modify it in one or the other way sometimes. To access these objects, the Classviewer provides the
"Globals" folder, containing subfolders for the following object types:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Structs</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Functions</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Variables</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>As the icons displaying these items are similar to those used in the class-viewer, their meaning is easy to guess and to remember by
the programmer.</para>

<para>Finally, it can be stated that the classviewer <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classviewer</primary></indexterm> displays your project graphically by their objects related to their appearance in the
code. In the following section you will learn how to use the classviewer <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classviewer</primary></indexterm> and it's tools in conjunction with your code.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="browsing-object-declarations-and-implementat">
<title>Browsing Object Declarations and Implementations</title>

<para>The Classviewer's best strength is providing a fast and good access to his code by the code's contents independent of the location
within files. Therefore, selections by a mouse click will result in the following actions:</para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis remap="bf">On a classname:</emphasis>  Switches to the class declaration <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>declaration</primary></indexterm></para>

<para><emphasis remap="bf">On a global function:</emphasis> Switches to the function's implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm></para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>Now, this provides you the most needed access towards code objects. Apparently, it may be needed to change a method's header, resulting
that you have to change it's declaration <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>declaration</primary></indexterm> in the class as well as the implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm>. The classviewer <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classviewer</primary></indexterm> supports this by providing
right-button context menus over items. On a method or function, this means that you can select where to go:</para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis remap="bf">Go to definition:</emphasis> Switches to the implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm>- this is the default for a left click as described above</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><emphasis remap="bf">Go to declaration <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>declaration</primary></indexterm>:</emphasis> Switches to the declaration <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>declaration</primary></indexterm> of the method or function.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>By this behavior, the Class Browser offers you access to every place you have to go for coding your C++ application.</para>

<para>The following sections give you a description of the other tools that the Class Browser offers- you will find them very useful when
working with large projects as they enhance working object-orientated on C++ programs.</para>

<para><indexterm><primary>classtools</primary></indexterm>
The classtools are dialogs that makes it even more easier for the developer to get more information about his project's classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm>.
The classviewer <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classviewer</primary></indexterm> displays all objects by their occurrence in the code, but you sometimes want to get more information about
classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> without having to look inside the code. Therefore, the classtool dialogs are specialized on displaying specific class
attributes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>attributes</primary></indexterm>.</para>

<para>The classtool dialog is invoked by the popup menu over a class in the classviewer <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classviewer</primary></indexterm>. Select "Classtool", and the dialog will appear.
To get informed about a class, select the class in the combo box on top. Then the buttons in the toolbar provide functions that give

<title>The Dialog Editor</title>

<para>The KDevelop integrated dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> allows the easy construction of widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm> and dialogs your application uses all by graphical means.
You see the direct appearance of your dialog as it will be presented to the user. Using the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> is usually the first step you
would take after creating a new project with the KAppWizard <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KAppWizard</primary></indexterm> to create your main view, the user interaction dialogs and, after finishing
the graphical work, the code generation. This way, your project will contain all the usually considered "difficult" parts that normally
would take a long time to implement. Then, the "rest" of your work is implementing the functionality in the generated code. This
chapter deals with how to use the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> to create your project widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm> as well as what to do in case you see your widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm> need
corrections or additions during the further development process.</para>

<para>You can switch to the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> either by selecting "Dialog Editor" from the "View <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>View</primary></indexterm>"-menu or by the according toolbar icon.
To switch back to the Project Editor, select "KDevelop" from the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm>'s "View <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>View</primary></indexterm>"-menu or by the icon in the toolbar.</para>

<para>What else does the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm>'s interface offer you ?  Mainly, that its appearance is almost the same as the project editor in term
of the main view separation as well as the menu- and toolbars. This allows you to make yourself accustomed with the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> very
quickly and, as he completely interacts with the project management, stay in the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> if you want to control your
build-process. Actions that require to switch back to KDevelop will do that automatically for you, like accessing the documentation
browser. Just select the menu commands, and KDevelop reacts to your will.</para>

<para>The following chapters give you an overview of the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> interface, how to create a new dialog initially and how set up the

<para>In the "Files" section, you have to enter the widget's specific information. This is the classname (which would be e.g. KColorSelectDlg
for a dialog that allows selecting the color of a pen), the header, C++ and Data filenames.
When inserting the Classname, the filenames are given by the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm>, but you can as well change the filenames.</para>

<para>Now, what about the files ? When you are ready with constructing the widget visually, you will have to generate the files that contain
the implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm> for your widget. As this will be a class, the dialog will exist by the header file containing the classdeclaration <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classdeclaration</primary></indexterm>,
a C++ file containing the method implementation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>implementation</primary></indexterm> for your widget's methods and slots. The Data file is the file that will contain a
function that is called by the constructor of your widget, the <emphasis>initDialog()</emphasis> method. The file itself shouldn't be changed as it
will contain the generated code from the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> to create the widget on the screen. If you ever have to change values, you should
do this by the constructor or be sure that you won't change the dialog during the development process, as the Data file will be
overwritten each time the code is generated for your widget. The header and C++ file contain sections, where the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> writes;
these are marked by comments. After file generation, you can change any values and settings outside these sections; otherwise your
changes will get lost by the next code-creation.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="location">
<title>Location</title>

<para>For generating the widget's sources, the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> needs to know the location where these will go. The default value for the
output <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>output</primary></indexterm> directory is the current project subdirectory containing the sources already present.</para>

<para>After pressing "OK", your default values are generated and an empty Widget constructor is opened. Then you are ready to go for creating
your own widget. Mind that the dialog editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>dialog editor</primary></indexterm> currently only supports static widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm> without geometry management. If you're about to use
geometry management for your widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm>, you should make yourself accustomed with the classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> that Qt provides for this, create a new
class with the classgenerator and write your widget by hand. For more information, see <ulink url="programming/index.html">The KDevelop Programming Handbook</ulink>.</para>

<sect1 id="adding-widgets">
<title>Adding Widgets</title>

<para>After specifying the dialogs or widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm> class and filenames, you are ready to start creating the widget and filling it with contents.
Adding low-level widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm> to your dialog is a very easy task. Just select the widget you want to add from the "Widgets" tabulator on the
left by a single click over the according widget icon. The widget will then be laid on the left upper corner of the currently opened
main widget. An added widget then gets the default size of 100x30 pixels on the editor <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>editor</primary></indexterm> view. To move a widget, click over it to
activate the drawing frame, which is displayed in dark grey with hot spots on the corners and on the center of the top, bottom, left
and right sides of the widget. A cross-cursor indicates that the widget can be moved. To move it, press the left mouse button and keep
it pressed. then move the widget with your mouse to the place you want to have it displayed later.</para>

<para>To resize a widget, move your mouse cursor over one of the hot spots of the already activated item. The mouse cursor then changes to a
double-arrow indicating the directions, in which resizing can be done. Press the left mouse button and hold it pressed. The widget item
will change it's size when the mouse is moved to the direction indicated by the cursor.</para>

<para>Further, the widget editor contains a lot of context menus to help you coordinate your work. Those are available over all items in the
widgets <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>widgets</primary></indexterm> tabulator and give you a quick help message window that shows the class name of the selected widget with a short description.

<para>Try setting BPs on lib load: This will try to set pending breakpoints on loading a library. If GDB hasn't seen a library that will be 
loaded via "dlopen" then it will refuse to set a breakpoint in that code. We can get gdb to stop on a library load and hence try to set 
the pending breakpoints. See <link linkend="Shared-libraries-and-breakpoints">Shared libraries and breakpoints</link> for more details 
and a "gotcha" relating to this behaviour. If you are not "dlopen"ing libs, leave this off.</para>

<title>The floating toolbar </title>

<para>The floating toolbar is a feature of the internal debugger, which greatly improves your comfort in debugging GUI applications. 
The toolbar is either on top of all windows displayed, or docked into the panel. When docked you can run your code by clicking on the 
docked icon. The function this performs is the "step over" function. Right clicking on the docked item allows you to restore the toolbar 
and optionally place focus on kdevelop.</para>

<para>Besides the <link linkend="Available-functions">functions available from the Debug Menu</link>, the floating toolbar offers two additional 
functions:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Set focus on kdevelop : Set the focus on kdevelop</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Set focus on app : This sets the focus on the window that had focus
when you pressed the "set focus on kdevelop" button. This is a
compromise, it should set the focus on the application being debugged but this
is difficult to do. If anyone has a better solution than the current functionality
then please let us know.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>When gdb interrupts the program, probably because a breakpoint has been triggered, we highlight the "Set focus on kdevelop". We do 
not automatically switch focus to kdevelop so that you can view the application window at this point. Click on the "set focus" button to 
switch to kdevelop or press a button on the toolbar to perform your selected function.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="shared-libraries-and-breakpoints">
<title>Shared libraries and breakpoints </title>

<para>Shared libraries and breakpoints have a problem that has a reasonable solution. The problem is that gdb will not accept breakpoints in 
source that is in a shared library which has not yet been opened but will be opened via a dlopen.</para>

<para>The solution is to get gdb to tell us when a shared library has been opened. We do so by setting "stop-on 1". This means that when the 
user sets a breakpoint, we flag this breakpoint as pending, try to set the breakpoint and if gdb says it succeeded then flag it as active. If 
gdb is not successful then we leave the breakpoint as pending. The next instruction will always be "continue" .</para>

<para>This is known as "lazy breakpoints"</para>

<para>However, this can lead to a problem when you use the "step over" command and step over code that will load a library. This will trigger a 
break on the library load, and, normally the debugger would do a "continue" (ie run to the next breakpoint or the end of the code). The user, 
however, is expecting the program to stop at the next line, so in this situation we do not continue, but leave it at that point (which will be somewhere 
inside a dlopen command). This is disconcerting but cannot be helped.</para>

<title>CVS Integration</title>

<para>KDevelop also takes care of managing your project via CVS repositories. The goal behind CVS (concurrent 
version control) is to enable groups of developers to work on the same source-tree independently and to merge 
changes into the repository. Usually, the repository is located at a server. The initial repository contains 
the base set of files that the project includes; directories and files are then added or removed to the CVS by 
the developers. Locally, the developer works on his copy of the CVS tree. He writes his changes into his files 
and tests, if his project still works, at least to a certain extend where incomplete sources don't prevent 
other developers from still working on the CVS repository if they receive the changes. </para>

<title>Configuring the Tools Menu</title>

<para><indexterm><primary>configuring the Tools-menu</primary></indexterm><indexterm><primary>"Options"-menu</primary></indexterm></para>

<para>As KDevelop supports the use of third-party programs within it's user interface, you are able to configure <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>configure</primary></indexterm> any program that suits
your needs towards application development. This can be done by adding programs to the already pre-defined ones in the
"Tools"-menu <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>"Tools"-menu</primary></indexterm>. To change the tools-menu, select "Tools <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Tools</primary></indexterm>" from the "Options" menu. This dialog allows to specify the entry
name, program and additional command line options you want to pass to the execution. To remove a program from the menu, select the
entry name and choose "Delete". To add a program, specify the menuentry, where a & is used as a menu-accelerator; you may compare the
already configured entries with the entry list. Select the binary and pass your commandline options. Then hit "Add" and the entry
is added to the list. After leaving the configuration dialog <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>configuration dialog</primary></indexterm>, the tools-menu updates itself, so the new configuration is already
usable without restarting KDevelop.</para>

<para>The Logical File Viewer can be configured by context menus completely. As it's intention is to separate files logically to keep a
better overview over complex projects, one of the most used configurations is to create file groups. Those can be set by opening the

<para><emphasis remap="bf">Make-command <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Make-command</primary></indexterm>:</emphasis>
The General Options dialog lets you configure KDevelop's general settings.
First, you should set the make-command <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>make-command</primary></indexterm> available on your system. If the selected program does not exist,
KDevelop will warn you the next time you're invoking a make command.</para>

<para><emphasis remap="bf">Autosave <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Autosave</primary></indexterm>:</emphasis></para>

<sect2 id="directoriesdocumentation-path">
<title>Directories<indexterm><primary>documentation path</primary></indexterm></title>

<para>For setting up the documentation browser <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>documentation browser</primary></indexterm> to work correctly, KDevelop needs some information about where the HTML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>HTML</primary></indexterm>-documentation
is placed on the system. Therefore, the Documentation Path properties dialog needs the path of the Qt- online documentation in HTML <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>HTML</primary></indexterm>
as well as the path to the KDE-Library documentation.</para>

<para>Usually, the Qt-Documentation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Qt-Documentation</primary></indexterm> is placed in the same directory where Qt is installed; e.g. if Qt resides in /usr/local/qt, the path
you have to enter is /usr/local/qt/html. For the KDE- Documentation, you have to set the directory to the root of the
documentation, assumed all KDE-Libs documentation resides in the same directory. Both path's can be selected by pressing the
according buttons, displaying a path-selection. If your system doesn't contain the documentation for the KDE-libs,  you should
first enter the next configuration dialog <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>configuration dialog</primary></indexterm>, Update KDE-Documentation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-Documentation</primary></indexterm>. This will create the documentation to a path of your choice,
also setting the KDE Library Doc path automatically.</para>

<sect3 id="update-kde-documentation-kde-documentation">
<title>Update KDE-Documentation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-Documentation</primary></indexterm></title>

<para>For those users who don't have a recent documentation of the KDE-libraries <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-libraries</primary></indexterm>, especially the documentation for the files
installed on the system, the Update KDE-Documentation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-Documentation</primary></indexterm> dialog creates a new one or updates existing documentations. This
function requires your system to have KDoc <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDoc</primary></indexterm> and qt2kdoc installed, included in the KDE-SDK <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDE-SDK</primary></indexterm> package. First of, you have
to set up the path to your recent kdelibs sources, which is not the include-path for KDE ! Just enter the path to the sources, like:
/home/rnolden/kdelibs-1.1/.</para>

<para>Then, you can choose three different installation modes, as:</para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para> Delete old Documentation and  install to recent Documentation-path:  this assumes that you already have a documentation
installed and is placed in the path the Documentation Path-dialog was entered. This will delete all documentation and install the
newly generated documentation into the recent path.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para> Delete old Documentation and install to new Documentation-path:   this will result in deleting the old documentation as
well as above, but gives you the choice to set up a new documentation place.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para> Leave old Documentation untouched and install to new Documentation path:   This is recommended for a new generation of
the kdelibs documentation for users who didn't have one before and for those who want to keep the last documentation for an older
kdelibs version.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>The "new KDE Libs Documentation path" is to be set  for option 2 and 3 of the installation mode.  This is also recommended for
users who generate a new documentation from scratch.</para>

<para>After pressing the OK button, KDevelop will create a subdirectory "KDoc <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDoc</primary></indexterm>-reference" in the documentation path containing the KDoc <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDoc</primary></indexterm>
reference files.  First, the qt library documentation classes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>classes</primary></indexterm> will be indexed to connect the Qt documentation with the
documentation to be generated for the kdelibs.  So it is important that you have set up the Qt documentation path first to ensure
that it can be found by <literal remap="tt">qt2kdoc</literal>. Finally, the KDE libs will be indexed and the documentation will be build with
cross-references to give browsing the most functionality.</para>

<para><note remap="comment"><para><emphasis remap="bf">NOTE:</emphasis> When using KDoc 2, you can add a set of documentation for the the libraries in the KDE-Base and KOffice
package. To do this, create the KDE-Libs documentation as described above. Then reopen the dialog and choose the path to the
<literal remap="tt">kdoc.rules</literal> file in the kdebase package resp. the koffice package, which is located in kdebase in the root directory of the
sources, in KOffice in koffice/lib. Select option 3 (Leave old Documentation untouched) and leave the output path below that option as
it is. This will keep the kdelibs documentation and generate the kdebase-libraries (resp. the koffice-libraries) documentation to the
same location with cross-references to the kdelibs documentation additionally. After generating the documentation the libraries are
available in the documentation tree automatically. For further KDE packages coming with additional libraries you should look for the
<literal remap="tt">kdoc.rules</literal> file to generate additional documentation as with the KDE-Base and KOffice packages.</para></note></para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="create-search-database">
<title>Create Search Database</title>

<para>The Create Search Database dialog, accessed via the create-button, allows the programmer to create a database to search for a
keyword interactively.  To create and use the documentation search function, you must have the program glimpse <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>glimpse</primary></indexterm> 4.0 or ht://Dig 
installed.
Preset are the options to index the given KDE-Library documentation as well as the Qt-Documentation <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Qt-Documentation</primary></indexterm>, assuming the path to the
documentation files were set in the "Documentation Path" dialog of the options- menu.   Additionally, the index can include
directories the user can set up himself by the "additional directories to index"-field.  After setting a path to an additional
directory, the "Add" - button must be pushed to set the path.  A path once set can be removed from the index by selecting the path
in the path field and pushing "Remove". Furthermore, the user is offered three different modes for the index size: tiny, small and
medium.  The higher the index size, the more the index files will grow. On the other hand, a search in a bigger search-database
will be faster and more successful, so we suggest choosing a "medium" size. For using the search function, see section
<link linkend="Using-the-Documentation-Browser">Using the Documentation Browser</link>.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="create-also-kdoc-reference-of-your-project">
<title>Create also KDOC-reference of your project</title>

<para>This option allows you to create a cross-reference file for your project when generating the API documentation 
with KDoc. The cross-reference file will be placed in the references directory and make your project available 
in the documentation tree. If you dont have write access to the directory containing the reference files you 
have to uncheck this option to generate the API documentation without errors.  </para>

how to run it.
Selecting the internal debugger enables an additional set of options you can choose from:</para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Display static members: Displaying static members makes gdb slower in producing data within kde and qt. It may change 
the "signature" of the data which QString and friends rely on. But if you need to debug into these values then check this option.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Display mangled names: When displaying the disassembled code you can select to see the methods mangled names. 
However, non-mangled names are easier to read.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Try setting BPs on lib load: This will try to set pending breakpoints on loading a library. If GDB hasn't seen a library that will be 
loaded via "dlopen" then it will refuse to set a breakpoint in that code. We can get gdb to stop on a library load and hence try to set 
the pending breakpoints. See <link linkend="Shared-libraries-and-breakpoints">Shared libraries and breakpoints</link> for more details 
and a "gotcha" relating to this behaviour. If you are not "dlopen"ing libs, leave this off.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Enable floating toolbar: This will allow you to use the floating toolbar to control the debugger in addition to the menu and buttons. 
The toolbar is most useful for debugging GUI applications. For details see <link linkend="The-floating-toolbar">The floating toolbar</link>.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Enable separate terminal for application i/o: This allows you to enter terminal input when your application contains

<chapter id="thanks">
<title>Thanks</title>

<para>We like to express special thanks to all of our family members and friends who supported us in several ways 
to let us construct and improve KDevelop.</para>

<para>Further, we thank  Jochen Wilhelmy  for offering his program kwrite and his help on integrating it into KDevelop.</para>

<para>Thanks also to the KDE team and Stephan Kulow, who gave us the possibility to work on KDevelop via CVS</para>

<para>We hope that our free work on this product will lead to a better acceptance of Free Software and its 
development. Without the help and idealism of many, the KDevelop IDE would never have been realized in such a 
short period of time and we're proud that so many users already have reported good experience and brought 
KDevelop to it's destiny: helping free software programmers to build a better world where users have the 
freedom of choice. </para>
