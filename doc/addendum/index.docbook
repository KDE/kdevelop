<chapter id="Preface">
<title>Preface</title>

<para>This handbook has been assembled to provide KDE developers the information they will need when porting their applications to KDE 2,
currently under development. KDE 2 is based on the Qt 2.x and KDE 1.1.x libraries, whereby the KDE libraries are ported to work with
the current Qt library. Further, the KDE libraries will introduce a component technology based on the MICO CORBA implementation which
is developed and tested with the KOffice suite.</para>

<para>As KDE application developers not involved in implementing for the KDE core team will probably want to port their applications, they
will not only have to watch out for the changes in Qt, but also for KDE's improvements and additions. As KDE 1.x applications will not
only be binary incompatible but also sourcecode incompatible, we want to provide enough information that can be used by developers that
are using the currently stable KDE 1.x implementation for applications that are suitable for production use, so transitioning will be
made less complicated and further implementations in current projects can be reviewed for possible problems that will arise when
porting.</para>

<para>Also the usual KDE developer does not have too much information about CORBA, not to speak of KOM. Therefore, this handbook tries to
give an insight where to get information and how the current implementation works in general. This will enable you to find out where
your applications can probably take advantage of distributed component technology where needed.</para>

<para>I want to thank all authors that were willing to contribute their current documentation to this handbook and hope this collection will
be of good use to those who want to stay on the bleeding edge of KDE development.</para>

<title>The KDE Developer's mini-HOWTO</title>

<para>David Sweet &lt;dsweet@chaos.umd.edu&gt;</para>

<para>August 14, 1999</para>

<para><emphasis>To help develop KDE or a KDE application you need to know
how to
(i) find KDE information and code, (ii) use CVS, and (iii)
compile. This document aims to help to you do these things without
losing too much hair.
This HOWTO is geared toward new developers, occasional
developers, and anyone considering contributing the the most excellent
free software project that is KDE.  It addresses questions that I and
others have been asking on the <emphasis remap="bf">kde-devel</emphasis> mailing list recently
along with some more general information.
You can find a current version of this document at the
<ulink url="http://www-chaos.umd.edu/~dsweet/KDE/DeveloperHOWTO">KDE Developer's HOWTO homepage</ulink>.

<title>General Information</title>

<para>The K Desktop Environment is an open source Unix desktop created by
volunteers from around the world.  There are many ways to contribute
to the project.  You can write new code, improve old code, write
documentation, translate to other languages, create artwork, sounds, &
music, report bugs, and suggest new features.  If you would like to
develop code, read on.  If you would like to contribute in another
way, please visit the KDE web site (<ulink url="http://www.kde.org">\|urlnam\|</ulink> name="http://www.kde.org"&gt;) for more information.</para>

<para>KDE uses the Qt toolkit which is developed by Troll Tech (<ulink url="http://www.troll.no">http://www.troll.no</ulink>). The main
components of the desktop are a file manager (kfm), window manager
(kwm), and panel (kpanel).  There are many more utilities and
applications which are included in the base distribution and available
elsewhere.</para>

<para>The primary programming language used for development is C++, although
bindings are available for Python (pyKDE).  The KDE code consists of libraries
containing classes for, for example: (libkdecore) an application base
(KApplication), accessing configuration files (KConfig), launching
external processs (KProcess); (libkdeui) widgets (KEdit, KFontDialog,
KToolBar, etc.); and other utility classes like KFileDialog (a file
dialog) and KSpell (a spellchecker).  Various desktop, configuration,
and system administration utilities are also included in the
distribution.  These are some of the things KDE developers work on.  A
more recent creation is KOffice, a productivity suite which includes a
word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation tool.</para>

<para>The currently released version of KDE is 1.1.1.  KDE 1.1.2 (that's
right, 1.1.2 is the name, not 1.2, according to release schedule
announcments made to <emphasis remap="bf">kde-devel</emphasis> by Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel) will
introduce theme support (which allows users to dramatically change the
appearance of their desktops), an integrated development environment,
KDevelop, and other development tools for KDE developers, and include
bugfixes.  The KDE 1.1.2 release schedule current reads:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Source .tgz's:  August 30</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Binary .rpm's:  September 6</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>KDE 2.0, which is, perhaps, the main focus of development right now, will
include rewrites or major updates of kfm, khtmlw (an HTML widget),
kpanel, kmail, and maybe kwm, unicode support, and much more.</para>

<para>KDE 2.0 requires mico, a free CORBA implementation.  CORBA is used to
make the new kfm (dubbed Konquerer) easily extensible and to create a
document-centric user interface for KOffice.  The user can, for
example, embed a chart created and edited with KSpread into a document
which has text created and edited by KWord.  Here's a bit from Simon
Hausmann about KOM/OpenParts
<programlisting> OpenParts is based on KOM. It provides an easy way to graphically
  embed other application's "widgets" , provides a clever way to manage
  shared GUI elements, together with a CORBA/KOM interface/implementation of
  these, and it implements the basic support for the document view model,
  extensively used by KOffice.</programlisting>

<title>Mailing lists</title>

<para>The list <emphasis remap="bf">kde-devel</emphasis> is for KDE developers in general.  The <emphasis remap="bf">kde-koffice</emphasis>
mailing list is for developers interested in koffice, and <emphasis remap="bf">kfm-devel</emphasis> is
for kfm (the file manager) developers.</para>

<para>Send a message to either <emphasis remap="bf">kde-devel-request</emphasis> or

myid@myserver stands for your email address).  Go to the KDE mail page
a click on "Mailing Lists" for more information about other KDE
mailing lists and the mailing list archive.</para>

<para>Toll Tech provides a list for users of the Qt 2.0 snapshots
(discussed below).  You may subscribe to this by sending an email to
snapshot-users-request@troll.no with the <emphasis>message</emphasis> "subscribe".</para>

<para>As a KDE developer you may want or need a kde email address, like
joedeveloper@kde.org.  To obtain one, send an email with a polite request to Martin Konold at konold@kde.org.</para>

<para>To gain access to the KDE CVS respository (discussed below), you firsly need
to have a good reason for wanting access.  For example, you may be maintaining
a CVS module.  If you think you have a good reason, send a polite email request
to Stephan Kulow &lt;coolo@kde.org&gt;.</para>

<para>You'll also need to send him an encrypted password to get the account
set up.  To create your encrpyted password, type:
<screen>	perl -e print\ crypt\('passwd','sa'\)\.\"\\n\"
</screen>

where <literal remap="tt">passwd</literal> is your choice of password and <literal remap="tt">sa</literal> is two random
characters from the set (a-zA-Z0-9./). The output is your encrypted
password.</para>

<title>Introduction</title>

<para>The KDE CVS (Concurrent Versions System) is the source code repository
for the KDE project.  You can access it via (i) WWW: http://www., (ii)
cvs utility, (iii) cvsup utility, or (iv) snapshots.  You will need
CVS access only for (ii); (i), (iii), and (iv) are read-only methods and
available to the public.</para>

<para>The web page for method (i) explains its usage.  I haven't an
explanation for method (iii), cvsup, yet.  Please see http://www.kde.org/cvsup.html
&lcub; -- Perhaps someone who
uses it will contribute a short explanation of usage and information
on obtaining it. -- &rcub;
The snapshots, (iv), are .tar.bz2 files which
contain a section of KDE code (called "modules"; ex, kdelibs,
kdeutils) as it looked on some specified day (specified in the
filename: ex, kdelibs990517.tar.bz2).  The snapshots are posted daily
inftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/unstable/CVS/snapshots. &lcub; (ii) is
described below. &rcub;</para>

<para>The repository (or, just "CVS") stores all of the changes
made to the source code by all of the contributors so that changes may
be undone.  Each time a user makes a change (s)he includes a comment
so that the devlopment of code can be more easily followed.  These
comments are sent to the kde-cvs mailing list.  The CVS splits into
&lowbar;branches&lowbar; which may contain different versions of the KDE project.
For example, the two branches being developed now are KDE&lowbar;1&lowbar;1&lowbar;BRANCH
and HEAD.  They both are derived from the same code (i.e., if you
"undid" enough of the changes made to either branch you'd reveal
identical source code) but used for different purposes.  Here are some
branches and descriptions for your reference:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para> KDE&lowbar;1&lowbar;1&lowbar;1&lowbar;RELEASE - code that was considered stable, released,
and distributed as KDE 1.1.1</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para> KDE&lowbar;1&lowbar;1&lowbar;BRANCH - derived from
KDE&lowbar;1&lowbar;1&lowbar;1&lowbar;RELEASE; being developed for KDE 1.1.2; will include
KThemeMgr, KDevelop, and bugfixes; based on Qt 1.42.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para> HEAD - code which will become KDE 2.0.  It is based on Qt 2.0, requires mico, has a new kwm, kpanel, etc.  LOTS of changes.</para>

it I would recommend reading the man page!  But, I've included
explanations of some common functions below.</para>

<para>Let's assume for this section that your username is <literal remap="tt">joedeveloper</literal>.
As written below you should enter all of these commands from some base
directory.  (KDE/CVS is not a bad choice!)</para>

<para>Set the environment variable <literal remap="tt">CVSROOT</literal> to
<literal remap="tt">:pserver:joedeveloper@cvs.kde.org:/home/kde.</literal></para>

<para><emphasis remap="bf">Listing CVS modules</emphasis>
You can't do this directly unfortunately.  You can, however, view the contents of the file /home/kde/modules with
<screen>        cvs -z6 co -c
</screen>
</para>

<para>The <literal remap="tt">-z6</literal> option tells the server to compress the code at "level 6"
before sending it to you.  This may speed things up for you.  (In this
case, since the module listing is small, it may not matter.)</para>

<para><emphasis remap="bf">Checking out a module</emphasis>, e.g. kdelibs from HEAD
<screen>	cvs -z6 checkout -r HEAD kdelibs

<para>The -r options tells cvs which branch you want to checkout from.  The
default is the HEAD branch.</para>

(3)	cvs -z6 co -l kdeutils/kjots
(4)	cd kdeutils; ln -s ../admin

</para>

<para>The <literal remap="tt">-l</literal> in line (1) tells cvs not to recurse the subdirectories of
kdeutils.  This means will get the configure script and its

<para>Line (2) gets the admin directory which contains support files for
autoconf and friends.  (This directory is retrieved automatically when
checking out an entire module.)</para>

<para>Line (3) gets the kjots source.</para>

<para>Line (4) makes a link to the admin directory.  (This is better than
copying or moving the directory here.  If you leave admin where cvs
put if then you can easily update the admin directory with cvs.  You
could also make links to admin from any other modules you check out
this way and thus have only one, up-to-date copy of admin.)</para>

<para>Before you start downloading and compiling the latest sources you

in a state of constant development so they could very well have bugs.</para>

<para>Knowing this, you should find a way to compile and run new KDE stuff
without interfering with your existing stable KDE setup.  Here's one
way, using the HEAD branch as an example.  We, again, assume your
login is joedeveloper.  We also assume that your home directory is in
/home/joedeveloper.  (This would be the case for Red Hat systems.)</para>

from the HEAD branch that you want.  The (minumum) modules needed to
use an application are: kdesupport, kdelibs.  You should compile and
install them in that order (see below for compiling).  Others you
might want are: kdebase, kdeutils, kdegraphics, etc. Now, make a

<sect1 id="Documentation">
<title>Documentation</title>

<para>It's important to document your application so that end-users can make
the most of it.  You should be clear and concise.  Describe any
non-standard installation, usage and UI features.  There's no need to
talk about how to use the <emphasis>File</emphasis> menu, for example, unless you've put
some special entry on it.  Include contact and bug-reporting
information as well as a hyperlink to the application's home page.
The best way to do this is by writing SGML and processing it with
<literal remap="tt">ksgml2html</literal>.</para>

<para>You should also document your widgets and other classes.  You can
include comments in your header ( <literal remap="tt">.h</literal>) files which describe
each <literal remap="tt">public</literal> or <literal remap="tt">protected</literal> method.  It you do this as you
write the methods it will make the documentation proceSss seem easier.
(It may also help you be certain about what function(s) that method is to
perform.)  The script <literal remap="tt">kdoc</literal> will turn your header files into
beautiful class documentation.  You can see examples of <literal remap="tt">kdoc</literal>
output if you look at <ulink url="http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~ssk/kde/srcdoc/kdecore/index-long.html">http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~ssk/kde/srcdoc/kdecore/index-long.html</ulink>.

</listitem>

</para>

<para>These three concepts are expanded upon in the next three subsections.</para>
<sect3 id="GNUConfigure">
<title>GNU Configure</title>

<para>The standard KDE application (or other code) source code package
includes the GNU <literal remap="tt">configure</literal> script which determines some
information about the user's system and provides it to your
source code as <literal remap="tt">&num;define</literal> statements in a header file called
<literal remap="tt">config.h</literal>.</para>

<para>To get started with this, get the kdesdk from CVS using a
method described above.  Then prepare kexample, an example
package, for your application
<screen>   cd kdesdk
   cd kexample
   make -f Makefile.cvs
   cd ..; cp -r kexample ~/KDE/kmyapp-0.0.1
</screen>

(That last directory is just an example.  Replace kmyapp with your
application's (or widget's) name, and replace 0.0.1 with its version
number.)</para>

<para>Now, we'll put your source code into the example package.  Let's
say your source code was in the directory  /KDE/KMyApp:
<screen>   cd ~/KDE/kmyapp-0.0.1
   mkdir kmyapp
   cp ~/KDE/KMyApp/*.cpp kmyapp
   cp ~/KDE/KMyApp/*.h kmyapp
   (There may be other files to copy, but leave your old Makefile behind!)
</screen>

Now, edit kmyapp-0.0.1/Makefile.am and change the line
<screen>   SUBDIRS = kexample
</screen>

to
<screen>   SUBDIRS = kmyapp
</screen>

<emphasis>Note</emphasis>:  kmyapp here refers to the subdirectory by that name.  You
could include more subdirectories to be compiled.  For example:
<screen>   SUBDIRS = kmyapp kmysupportclass
</screen>
</para>

<para>Also edit the last line of configure.in to read
<screen>AC_OUTPUT(Makefile \
          kmyapp/Makefile \
          po/Makefile)
</screen>

The <literal remap="tt">po</literal> directory contains translations of strings that you
used in your code (this is about i18n(), which is not covered in this
HOWTO).  We'll get to that it a minute.</para>

<para>Now we want to set up the Makefile for the kmyapp subdirectory.  Edit
<literal remap="tt">kmyapp/Makefile.am</literal> according to the instructions given in the
comments.  They should be clear enough.</para>

<para>Now <literal remap="tt">cd &tilde;/KDE/kmyapp</literal> and type
<screen>   ./configure
</screen>

This should create:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para> Makefile</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para> kmyapp/Makfile</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para> config.h</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

You can now include config.h in your source code with <literal remap="tt">&num;include "../config.h"</literal> and have your code compile differently on different systems based
on the <literal remap="tt">&num;define</literal>s.  Eh?  Well, different systems have slightly
differnent ideas about implementing standards and such, and your
code my need take this into account to be portable, i.e. to work on
various Unices.  Take a look inside <literal remap="tt">config.h</literal> for descriptions
of the <literal remap="tt">&num;define</literal>s.</para>

<para><emphasis remap="bf">Shared Libraries!</emphasis>  If you are packaging a widget or other class
you should be compiling a shared library.  Luckily, this is easy to do
within the kexample packge.  You only need to change the Makefile.am
that resides in your code's sudirectory.  Unluckily, now example
for a shared-library Makefile.am is included.  So, I've included one
in the next section.
<emphasis>Note</emphasis>:  If you distribute a widget, you should also
disrtribute a small program which tests the widget.  Put that
program in the same package in another subdirectory and have it
compile along with the widget.</para>

<para>Next, make a compressed archive.  You can do it this way
<screen>   cd ~/KDE
   tar -cvf kmyapp-0.1.1.tgz kmyapp-0.1.1
</screen>

or however you like.  Just be sure that the archive expands to
<emphasis>one</emphasis> directory containing all of the files.  This is neater and
easier for the user to deal with.</para>

<para>If you are hacking at CVS, you should follow the commit procedure
outlined above.  If you want to submit changes to code
that you are not maintaining, you should first check with the
maintainer of the application.  You can usually find his/her email address

if it has one.  If no maintainer is specifically listed, you should
contact the author.</para>

<para>When you do this be sure to include an <literal remap="tt">.lsm</literal> (Linux Software Map) file.
This way your code can be automatically placed in the appropriate spot
on ftp.kde.org and its mirrors and an announcement can be
automatically sent to the kde-announce mailing list.</para>

<para><emphasis>Note</emphasis>: The <literal remap="tt">.lsm</literal> file should be uploaded separately from the

<title>Using KDE I/O Slaves</title>

<para>Kurt Granroth <ulink url="mailto:granroth@kde.org">&lt;granroth@kde.org&gt;</ulink></para>

<para>v0.1, 15, June 1999</para>

<para><emphasis>This HOWTO describes how the KDE I/O slaves (ioslaves) work.  It is
intended for both ioslave implementers as well as users.  In this
document, I will attempt to describe both how ioslaves work as well
as how to use them.</emphasis></para>

<sect1 id="KDEIOSlavesIntroduction">
<title>Introduction</title>
<sect2 id="WhatAreIOSlaves">
<title>What Are I/O Slaves?</title>

<para>The K Desktop Environment (KDE) I/O slaves (ioslaves) are a series of
small programs that have intimate knowledge on working with a very
specific protocol.  For instance, the HTTP ioslave (<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kio&lowbar;http</literal></primary></indexterm>kio&lowbar;http</literal>)
knows all about sending and receiving data to and from a <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>web server</primary></indexterm>web server.  It
knows all about <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>SSL</primary></indexterm>SSL, encoding, and what all of the different header fields
mean.  It knows this so that KDE developers won't have to -- if they want
a web page, they merely have to use <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kio&lowbar;http</literal></primary></indexterm>kio&lowbar;http</literal> for it and it will
take care of everything for them.</para>

<para>The ioslaves are based on the KIO library (<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>libkio</literal></primary></indexterm>libkio</literal>).  This library
implements a method of asynchronous communication between
applications as well as provides a "protocol registry" of sorts.
This has many advantages.  Two of the major ones are:</para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>The client does not need to know anything about the ioslave that
it is calling.  It merely specifies the protocol and <literal remap="tt">cdx/libkio/</literal> will
automatically determine the proper ioslave to use.
	</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>All communication is done asynchronously.  All <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>libkio</literal></primary></indexterm>libkio</literal> calls will
return immediately.  Whenever events occur, <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>libkio</literal></primary></indexterm>libkio</literal> will send
signals altering the client to that fact.  This means that the
client does not have to engage in any "busy waiting."</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>Here is a fully working snippet of code to download a web page:<indexterm remap="ncdx"><primary><literal>KIOJob</literal></primary></indexterm><indexterm remap="ncdx"><primary><literal>sigData()</literal></primary></indexterm></para>

<para><programlisting> KIOJob *job = new KIOJob;
 connect(job, SIGNAL(sigData(int, const char*, int)),
         this, SIGNAL(slotData(int, const char*, int)));
 job-&gt;get("http://www.kde.org/news_dyn.html");
 </programlisting>
</para>

<para>That's it!  When the ioslave is done getting the KDE news page, it
will call your application's slotData() function with the page.</para>

either CVSUP or the snapshots.  See www.kde.org (or a later appendix
when I get around to it later) for details on that.</para>

<sect1 id="ObjectModelIntroduction">
<title>Introduction</title>

<para>Although it is nice to have applications like StarOffice and
ApplixWare available for Unix/Linux, it is a sad fact that they do not
interact with other applications. In fact user is expected to use the
supplied e-mail-client only, the StarOffice spreadsheet cannot be
embedded into an Applix document, and users cannot use the WWW
browser of their choice.</para>

<para>Even a rather simple component-based approach like COM (Component
Object Model) can do lots of magic. Take a glimpse into Bill Gates'
world to convince yourself. The spread sheet of one software house can
be used in a word processor of another and many applications support
scripting interfaces. A veritable industry of OCX/ActiveX component
writers has cropped up. Using easy to learn languages such as Visual
Basic, users with a minimal programming background can glue separate
components together with ease in order to create new applications
exhibiting previously unavailable functionality. As Aristotle put it:
The whole is more than the sum of its parts.</para>

<para>Even the most faithful of all Unix supporters had to recognize that
the Unix community had technologically fallen far behind the windows as
well as Macintosh worlds with regard to GUI and desktop technologies.
Fortunately, distributed objects make sense beyond a the realm of
desktop and GUI applications. The development of distributed databases
may serve as an example and component technology in general fits
nicely into the strategy of major software companies which in turn
helped to push CORBA development on the UNIX platform. Consequently,
there is a standardized, network transparent, platform- and
language-independent solution to the IPC-problem available, that is
based on an object-oriented approach and that offers exception
handling as well as support for management of complex data structures.</para>

<para>While initially only available commercially, free implementations of
the CORBA 2.0 standard object request broker (ORB) became available as
well.  A particularly well done free implementation of the CORBA
standard, that will soon cover the full CORBA-2.1 standard, was
developed at the university of Frankfurt, Germany.  This GNU GPL'd ORB
named MICO, can compete with commercial implementations with respect to
completeness and stability.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="CORBAbasedKDEObjectModel">
<title>CORBA-based KDE Object Model</title>

<para>However, CORBA alone is not enough, as the standard only describes how
distributed objects communicate; the COSS (CORBA Standard Services)
define interfaces for a whole range of so called services, such as
trading services, security services, transactions sercies and license
management services and others. As is apparent, desktop development or
even GUI application development did not play an important role when
designing CORBA. The nearly indispensable event service does not
support event filtering, furthermore it lacks a mechanism for so
called 'callbacks'. Thus, in order for X11 and CORBA to work well
together, CORBAs well done industry standard object model had to be
enhanced in order to be suitable as the underlying distributed object
broker on which to build the all important compound document
framework.  Of course all this had to be undertaking within the limits
of the accepted CORBA industry standards.</para>

<para>The KDE Object Model (KOM) addresses these issues and makes life
easier for a programmer by automatically giving each object a base set
of functionalities. This includes first and foremost event
handling. Each KOM object is capable of receiving events. An event
consists of an arbitrary data structure (<literal remap="tt">CORBA::Any</literal>) as well
as a string, describing the type of the event, for example
Desktop/Font/ChangeFont or Desktop/Color. By reading this string, an
object can decide whether it is interested in that event, and will
know how the unknown data structure is to be interpreted semantically.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="Flexibilitywitheventsandfilters">
<title>Flexibility with events and filters</title>

<para>An important aspect when processing events is filtering. It allows the
developer to enhance the functionality of a program without having to
change the sources.  There are three types of filters: those which
merely recognize events, those which are allowed to change or discard
events, and finally those which finally process them.  This model can
be illustrated with a simple WWW browser example: If a program wants
the browser to open a new URL, it has to send it an event. To enhance
the browser with a history function and the user only has to plug in a
filter of the first category into the browser. This filter can record
all URLs, thereby managing a history function. A tool for blocking
certain pages (in order to protect minors for example) belongs to
category two: If the URL is rated unsuitable for minors, the filter
discards the event or replaces the URL in it with a different one. If
the Browser does not support mailto, we need a third category filter:
upon arrival of a URLOpen event with mailto:joe@doe in it, the event
is discarded from the browser's point of view, but the filter offers
an alternative implementation.</para>

<para>The filter principle is of great importance, as in CORBA only
interfaces are inherited, not implementations.  It would not be
possible to derive from the browser object and to just overload the
function that opens a new URL. The event model does not just solve
this problem, it enables developers to install several enhancements at
the same time. A second filter, filtering FTP URLs for example, can be
easily installed in addition. It is important that an user can plug-in
an arbitrary number of such filters at run-time. A filter is installed
this way:</para>

<para><screen>
      KOM::EventTypeSeq types;

      types.length (1);

      types [0] = CORBA::string_dup ("OpenURL");

      browser-&gt;installEventFilter ( this, "eventFilter", types);


</screen>
</para>

<para>Now, all you have to do is wait for events:</para>

<para><screen>
boolean MailFilter::eventFilter (in Object obj, in EventType type, in any value)
{

    if ( type == "OpenURL" )
    {

        char *p;

        if (( value &gt;&gt;=p ) && strcmp (type, "mailto:", 7) == 0)
        {

            // open mail app

            CORBA::string_free (p);

            return true;

        }
    }

     return false;
}


</screen>
</para>

<para>When a user enters a URL in the example above, the browser sends an
event to itself. This concept can also serve for a macro recorder,
because events can be filtered, saved and re-send later. As event
handling works the same way for all KOM objects, there is now - at
last - the possibility of creating a supra-component macro recording.</para>

<para>To avoid performance loss, filters can be installed in a way that they
only receive events whose type matches a certain
expression. Desktop/Font/* would filter all events that have to do
with the font settings of the whole desktop.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="Callbackswithsignalandslots">
<title>Callbacks with signal and slots</title>

<para>In an event-driven environment, programmers have to deal with so
called callbacks. A callback is a mechanism by which a button for
example activates a procedure that is supposed to be called once the
button is pressed. C offers pointers to functions for that, under C++
we can use elegant signals and slots. A wonderful implementation of
this idea is offered by the QT toolkit. KOM offers this technique for
distributed objects as well, it uses CORBAs DII (Dynamic Invocation
Interface) for that purpose. An object can be target and sender of
signals at the same time. To receive a signal, an object must have a
slot with a matching list of parameters. Such a slot is not different
from a usual CORBA method without return value. The lines</para>

<para><screen>
      MySender_var s = new MySender;

      MyReceiver_var r = new MyReceiver;

      r.connect ( "selected", s, "myslot" );


</screen>
</para>

<para>connect two objects with each other. As soon as <literal remap="tt">s</literal> emits the
selected signal, the function myslot of object <literal remap="tt">r</literal> is
called. If one of the objects is destroyed, the connection between the
two is released automatically. It is possible to connect one signal to
different slots and one slot to different signals. Theoretically, it
would also be possible to work with events here. Signals and slots
however work a lot faster and are easier to handle for the programmer,
because he/she does not have to deal with event
processing. Furthermore they are type-safe. On the other hand, you
have to work without the advantages of filtering.</para>

<para>As already mentioned, interface inheritance does not solve all
problems. The browser example shows that installing multiple
enhancements at run-time works only because filters are loaded which
can plug into the browser. The principle behind this mechanism is
called dynamic aggregation. You take a core object (the browser) and
enhance it by other objects (plug-ins). The interface of the browser
is expanded with the sum of the plug-ins' interfaces. KOM support
run-time installation and uninstallation of those plug-ins. Neither is
required to run within the same process or even the same computer.</para>

<para>An object that communicates with the browser does not notice which
interface was implemented by the core object and which by the
plug-ins. If a client wants to know whether a component supports a
special interface, a simple</para>

<para><screen>
CORBA::Object_var obj = browser-&gt;getInterface ('IDL:/foo/bar:1.0');


</screen>
</para>

<para>is enough to get a reference to that interface. It is even possible to
load the plug-in with the required interface at run-time. This saves a
lot of memory, because the plug-ins allocate resources only then when
they are really needed.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="OpenPartsKOMmeetsGUI">
<title>OpenParts: KOM meets GUI</title>

<para>Until now, the word GUI has not been mentioned a single time. Indeed,
KOM is solely based on CORBA. There are in effect quite a number of
applications which do not have or do not need a GUI. It would not make
sense to burden those applications with GUI code; we better leave that
to the supporters of the Redmond doctrine. OpenParts form a layer on
top of CORBA, KOM, and X11. Embedding GUI components in own programs
has become widely known since introduction of MS Internet Explorer
4.0. In the windows world, a lot of controls have been created, a
whole industry has formed around the creation of controls and nearly
everything, from a simple push-button to a complete WWW browser, can
be realized as a control.</para>

<para>The idea behind controls is actualized in KDE's OpenParts. This is
done using window objects that export a well-defined interface. The
CORBA Implementation Repository registers the implementation of those
components.</para>

<para>When an application needs a specific control, it relays a request to
the repository. In the OpenParts framework, separate server processes
handle these requests. Thus, a high level of toolkit, compiler,
language and multi threading-support independence is achieved. The
repository returns a reference to a factory. CORBA does not support
the creation of new objects with a special construct. Because of that,
factories have been introduced, which serve the purpose of creating a
new object and returning a reference to it.</para>

<para>The actual embedding is done via X11 swallowing. The element that is
to be embedded (a X11 window) is assigned a new parent using the X11
Xlib call <literal remap="tt">XReparentWindow</literal>. In order to keep developers away
from messing around with pure X11, there exist so called control
frames. This class depends on the used toolkit and (viewed from
outside) looks like a normal window implemented using a specific GUI
toolkit. The control frame is made the new father of the control. Is
it moved or resized, the control is moved or resized as well.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="DynamicElementsrealizedeasily">
<title>Dynamic Elements realized easily</title>

<para>Some elements of a window are subject to restrictions. There can only
be one menu bar as well as one status bar. Great confusion would ensue
if controls were allowed to take control of these restricted
elements. One way to avoid this confusion is offered by an enhancement
of controls: Parts. A part can be in three different modes: inactive,
marked, or active. In a top-level window only one can be active. This
part gains control over the restricted elements. The top-level window
is called PartShell; it owns menu bar, tool bars, status bar etc. Each
part can register its menus and toolbars with the Shell. The Shell,
however, only displays the restricted elements of the active Part.</para>

<para>Using Parts, one can build the basic structure of an integrated office
suite. Text processing, spread sheet, drawing application and all the
rest is put into such structures. As Parts can contain Parts, a
spread-sheet Part can be embedded into a text-Part with no
problems. Instead of ControlFrames, the developer can use the mightier
PartFrames as well. A single click on a part creates a window frame,
the user can move and resize the frame now; another click makes it
active. The window frame is changed automatically to show the user,
that the part has been made active. The Shell changes menu bar and
tool bar to the needs of the Part that has become active.</para>

<para>What is missing is a common file menu: it is the Shell's privilege to
provide a menu and a toolbar of its own for that purpose. Via these
widgets, the user can access the document as a whole, for example to
save or print it.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="TheDocumentViewArchitecture">
<title>The Document View Architecture</title>

<para>OpenParts support the Document View Model, known from Smalltalk and
popularized in Microsoft's MFC. A view displays the document on the
screen and is derived from the Parts class. The document contains data
as well as the associated algorithms. The advantage of this solution is
that users can have several views of the document. It is, for example,
possible to display two paragraphs of a longer article in two windows
or to display an image in a separate window when manipulating it. When
zooming in on this picture, the rest of the document does not have to
be enlarged as well.</para>

<para>For reasons of performance, document and view run within the same
process. In order to achieve a clean design, the developer has to
strictly follow the principle of separating data and belonging
manipulating algorithms on one side and viewing algorithms on the
other side. Every user action first affects the view. This view must
then signal the Document to change the data basis accordingly. After
that, the Document must inform all views to update their windows
in order to correctly reflect the new data state.</para>

<para>An important aspect is using a Document without a View. This allows to
make use of an office suite's functionality in a batch job, for
example. The Document should export methods for manipulating data. A
CORBA-aware scripting language could make use of those methods. At
this time, CORBA-binding for Perl, Tcl, and CORBA-Script exist, a
Python binding is being worked on.</para>

<para>Object models, and operating systems are alike in that they are of
mere academic value as long as there are no applications making use of
their qualities. KOffice is, at the moment, the largest and most
widely known application using OpenParts technology. As the KDE
project makes wider use of CORBA, and KOM and OpenParts respectively,
there is reason to hope that Unix will soon have a free implementation
of a object model that transfers the advantages of contemporary
compound document framework technology to the user.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="UsingOpenPartsKOffice">
<title>Using OpenParts: KOffice</title>

<para>Based on OpenParts technology, the KOffice project aims at offering a
free and easily extendible office suite for KDE.</para>

<para>The 'mother' of all KOffice components (called Parts) is the spread
sheet KSpread. Although officially still declared 'alpha', it is
already working very well.. Its mathematical functions can be easily
enhanced by means of an embedded Python language interpreter.</para>

<para>KPresenter is a presentation application written by Reginald
Stadlbauer, which convincingly demonstrated its usability at the Linux
Congress in Cologne where a talk about KDE was given using
KPresenter. In the future, Linus Torvalds will no longer have use
Windows applications when giving presentations.</para>

<para>KChart is an application to create diagrams. It supports different
modes (bars, lines, etc.) and can be embedded into other KOffice
application without problems. When data is changed in, for example,
KSpread, the chart automatically changes itself accordingly.</para>

<para>There is a component for displaying graphics, and work is being done
adapting a formula editor and a vector-oriented painting application
(KIllustrator). For the future, adaptation of KLyx is planned to embed
Parts in LaTeX documents. Other KDE applications like KOrganizer,
KAddressbook and KMail will be enhanced with CORBA interfaces to
provide seamless integration in the KOffice suite.</para>

<para>If possible, components save their data in XML format. To save an
aggregate document in a file, the MIME multi-part format is used. XML
and MIME multi-part share the advantage that import and exports filters
can easily be written in scripting languages like Python and
Perl. Ever since a WinWord filter attracted attention on
c.o.l.a. (comp.os.linux.announce), developers began writing import
filters for the most important MS applications.</para>

<para>KOffice runs quite stably for a alpha release. To compile it, a fast
CPU and a reasonable amount of RAM ( 64 MByte) should be available;
for using KOffice, 32 MByte and a Pentium 133 MHz will
suffice. KOffice is reported to work on DEC Alpha and Sun Sparcs as
well. The sources for KOffice, KOM and OpenParts are available on
<ulink url="http://www.kde.org">http://www.kde.org</ulink></para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="CodeReusewithCORBA">
<title>Code Re-use with CORBA</title>

<para>A developer, sitting in front of his editor and trying to build new
software components out of old ones, might sadly remember the good old
Lego pieces from his/her childhood. Those always fit together nicely,
and from a great number of primitive elements, great buildings could be
constructed. From the software developer's point of view, software
pieces do not fit at all, and each new building requires a lot of work
to make it usable. Many developers therefore choose to rewrite the
sources rather than to re-use code.</para>

<para>Under Unix, the usual method concerning code re-use is putting code
into libraries and linking the application against them. However,
sometimes it happens that those libraries use different GUI toolkits,
or that some support multi-threading and some do not. Additionally,
all libraries should have been compiled with the same compiler,
otherwise you will be subject to problems at the linking stage.</para>

<para>One solution is to split an application into several processes. One
process might, for example, offer database functionality with
multi-threading, another one might offer the X11-GUI
single-threaded. Now, the problem of Interprocess Communication (IPC)
remains to be solved. CORBA (Common Object Request Broker
Architecture) offers a modern and object-oriented solution, but the
developer is tied to the CORBA object model, what is somewhat limited
in contrast to the C++, Python or Smalltalk object model. First of all
one can derive only from interfaces, not from implementations. If
there is a text editor as a CORBA object, it usually is impossible to
derive from this editor and overload just a few of its functions. The
derivation of implementations works only if the sources of the editor
are available, or if it is available as a library. But that was what
we wanted to avoid.</para>

<para>As the main article describes, the KDE Object Model (KOM) offers a
solution for this problem; it is based on events and event
filters. Instead of calling a function directly, it is possible to
send an event. By filtering events, function overloading can be
simulated.</para>

<para>There are other obstacles when re-using code: According to Murphy's
laws, the desperately needed module is always written in a different
programming language than expected. Mixing different languages in one
application is always a problem for programmers. Even semi-automatic
wrapper generators like SWIG expect a certain amount of refining from
the programmer. Further, a look at the KDE bindings in Python, Perl
and Tcl shows that this wrapper code can easily grow huge. As
OpenParts is CORBA-based, objects can be implemented in any of the
languages for which CORBA bindings are available for. For interpreter
languages, in most cases no special wrapper code is necessary, for
compiler languages like C/C++, wrapper code generation is done
automatically.</para>

<title><indexterm remap="idx"><primary>Signals and Slots</primary></indexterm>Signals and Slots</title>

<para>KOM supports signals and slots just like in the Qt toolkit, with a few
differences in usage and implementation. The first and biggest difference is
that signals and slots are no more typesafe again, meaning there's no moc
compiler generating meta data for KOM signals/slots to enable type checking at
run-time, when connecting.</para>

<para>Another difference is the way you declare signal and slot functions. Signals
have to be declared with the <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>SIGNAL&lowbar;IMPL</literal></primary></indexterm>SIGNAL&lowbar;IMPL</literal> macro from <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>komBase.h</literal></primary></indexterm>komBase.h</literal>,
without  specifying any signal arguments. Slot methods have to be defined in
your CORBA  interface description.</para>

<para>For KOM signals the equivalent to the "emit" keyword from Qt is the
<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>SIGNAL&lowbar;CALL</literal></primary></indexterm>SIGNAL&lowbar;CALLx</literal> macro, were "x" is one of 0, 1, 2, depending on the
number of arguments.
<indexterm><primary>KOM::Base</primary></indexterm>
Example:</para>

<para>In your CORBA interface description:
<programlisting>  #include &lt;kom.idl&gt;

  interface FooSender : KOM::Base
  {
    signal void mySignal( in long foobaz );
  };

  interface FooReceiver : KOM::Base
  {
    slot void mySlot( in long gosh );
  };</programlisting>
</para>

<para>In the implementation of FooSender:
<programlisting>  FooSender_Impl::FooSender_Impl( ... )
  {
    ...
    SIGNAL_IMPL( "mySignal" );
    ...
  }

  FooSender_Impl::mySignal( CORBA::Long foobaz )
  {
    SIGNAL_CALL1( "mySignal", foobaz );
  }</programlisting>
</para>

<para>In the implementation of FooReceiver:
<programlisting>  FooReceiver_Impl::mySlot( CORBA::Long gosh )
  {
    ...
  }</programlisting>
</para>

<para>First some words about the sender: It is not required to define the signal
in the interface description and to provide an implementation which simply
emits the signal. However in many cases this is recommended, because this makes
it easier for other developers to use your interface because they aren't required
to seek in the implementation sources just to find out about the signals this
object emits. Another way is to simply document the existence of the signal
in the interface description, without defining a method. From the technical
point only the <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>SIGNAL&lowbar;CALL</literal></primary></indexterm>SIGNAL&lowbar;CALLx</literal> macro counts when emitting the signal.</para>

<para>What's left is connecting and disconnecting. In the above described example it
could like this:
<programlisting>  ...
  SenderObject-&gt;connect( "mySignal", ReceiverObject, "mySlot" );
  ...
  SenderObject-&gt;disconnect( "mySignal", ReceiverObject", "mySlot");</programlisting>
</para>

<para>Well, this is quite self-explaining I think. Just make sure to always disconnect
from your object upon destruction.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="Events">
<title>Events</title>

<para>An event consists of two elements, the event name, being a string, and an
event argument, being a CORBA::Any value and therefore freely choosable by the
developer.</para>

<para>Events, sent to a specified object, can be imagined as being put through a
pipe until they reach the destination object. This "pipe" is filled with
installed  event filters. There are three kinds of filters.
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>reading filters ( <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>FM&lowbar;READ</literal></primary></indexterm>FM&lowbar;READ</literal> )</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<para>implementing filters ( <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>FM&lowbar;IMPLEMENT</literal></primary></indexterm>FM&lowbar;IMPLEMENT</literal> )</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>In the current implementation in KOM these filter modes only specify the order
how the event is processed. When an event is emitted it gets first filtered by
all event filters with the filter mode <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>FM&lowbar;WRITE</literal></primary></indexterm>FM&lowbar;WRITE</literal>, then followed by
<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>FM&lowbar;IMPLEMENT</literal></primary></indexterm>FM&lowbar;IMPLEMENT</literal> and finally by <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>FM&lowbar;READ</literal></primary></indexterm>FM&lowbar;READ</literal>. Event filters have two
possibilities what they can do with the actual event: They can just
<emphasis remap="bf">read</emphasis> it or they can <emphasis remap="bf">discard</emphasis>  it, which means the event is
discarded and will never receive its destination  object.</para>

<para>The actual event name has a special meaning in regard to event filters.  When
installing an event filter to an object you have to specify, beside a
reference to the filter object and the name of the filter mapping function, a
sequence of so called event type patterns. An event type pattern can be the
name of a  single event as well as a special pattern (see <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kom.idl</literal></primary></indexterm>kom.idl</literal> for more
information about event type patterns) .</para>

<para>When an event is meant to be processed by a filter, the specified filter
function gets called, with the event name and the event value as arguments.
This filter function has to return (through a boolean value) whether the event
should be discarded or not.</para>

<para>When all filtering is done and none of the installed filters discarded the
event, it is finally received by the destination object, by calling the
object's <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>event()</literal></primary></indexterm>event()</literal> method, defined in the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KOM::Base</primary></indexterm>KOM::Base interface. The default
implementation does actually nothing, so you may want to re-implement this
virtual function.</para>

<para>The very low-level usage of events is to call the receive/receiveASync methods
of an object for sending an event and to re-implement <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KOMBase::event</literal></primary></indexterm>KOMBase::event for
mapping an event. But KOM provides some nice macros which simplify the
processing of events.</para>
<sect3 id="SendingEvents">
<title>Sending Events</title>

<para>For sending komBase.h defines some useful <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>EMIT&lowbar;EVENT</literal></primary></indexterm>EMIT&lowbar;EVENT</literal> macros, all
using the same syntax:
<literal remap="verb">EMIT_EVENT_x( destination_object, event_name, event_argument)</literal></para>

<para>"destination&lowbar;object" is a reference to the object which is meant to
receive/process the event. The event will be filtered through all event
filters which are installed in this destination object. "event&lowbar;name" is
self-explaining ;-) . The event argument depends on the specific macro, which
are in particular:</para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para><literal remap="tt">EMIT&lowbar;EVENT</literal>, the general macro for sending. The event argument is
required to have a <literal remap="tt">&lt;&lt;=</literal> operator for CORBA::Any defined. You
will want to use this macro whenever the event argument is a structure
for example. (and don't forget to compile your idl file with the "--any"
option, so that the idl compiler generates the necessary operator
methods)</para>

<para><literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>EMIT&lowbar;EVENT&lowbar;BOOLEAN</literal></primary></indexterm>EMIT&lowbar;EVENT&lowbar;BOOLEAN</literal>, useful for boolean event arguments. The
only difference to the <literal remap="tt">EMIT&lowbar;EVENT</literal> macro is that it uses
CORBA::Any::from&lowbar;boolean for you to convert the boolean value. So it
doesn't really matter whether you use:

<literal remap="verb">    EMIT_EVENT( receiver, name, CORBA::Any::from_boolean( value ) );</literal>

<sect3 id="ReceivingEvents">
<title>Receiving Events</title>

<para>The process of receiving events is a little bit more difficult, compared
to sending, since we have to process all kinds of events an object can receive
in one handler method, <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KOM::Base</primary></indexterm>KOM::Base::event (<indexterm remap="idx"><primary>IDL</primary></indexterm>IDL) / KOMBase::event (C++) . Just
like with sending events you can again do everything on low CORBA level, but
why should we go the hard way? KOM again provides very nice and easy-to-use
macros for this (defined in komBase.h) :-) . Usually all this looks like the
following example:<indexterm><primary>KOM::Base</primary></indexterm>
<programlisting>#include &lt;kom.idl&gt;

module MyModule
{
  // we say: the event argument is a string
  const string eventFirstFoo = "MyFooEventNameOrWhateverYouNameIt";

  struct MyStruct
  {
    boolean kde_rules;
  };

  const string eventSecondFoo = "Blaafooo";
  typedef MyStruct EventSecondFoo;

  interface SomethingElse
  {
    //..
  };

  const string eventThirdFoo = "KOMIsCool";
  typedef SomethingElse EventThirdFoo;

  interface Foo : KOM::Base
  {
    //...
  };

};

bool FooImpl::event( const char *event, const CORBA::Any &amp;value )
{
  EVENT_MAPPER( event, value );

  MAPPING_STRING( MyModule::eventFirstFoo, mappingFirstFoo );

  MAPPING( MyModule::eventSecondFoo, MyModule::EventSecondFoo, mappingSecondFoo );

  MAPPING( MyModule::eventThirdFoo, MyModule::EventThirdFoo_ptr, mappingThirdFoo );

  END_EVENT_MAPPER; //the macro executes "return false;" for us, to indicate that
                    //we did not handle the event if we reach this point
}

bool FooImpl::mappingFirstFoo( const char *myArgument )
{
  ...
  //don't forget to return with a boolean value, indicating whether you sucessfully
  //processed the event or not.
}

bool FooImpl::mappingSecondFoo( MyModule::MyString anotherArg )
{
  //...
}

bool FooImpl::mappingThirdFoo( MyModule::SomethingElse_ptr whaaboo )
{
  //...
}
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>As you can see an event handler usually begins with the <literal remap="tt">EVENT&lowbar;MAPPER</literal>
macro and ends with <literal remap="tt">END&lowbar;EVENT&lowbar;MAPPER</literal> . Similar to the
<literal remap="tt">EMIT&lowbar;EVENT&lowbar;x</literal> macros, the <literal remap="tt">MAPPING</literal> macros consist of a general
<literal remap="tt">MAPPING</literal> macro and the following friends:

<para>In order to structurize the process of event handling a little bit, every
event  gets its own event handling function. These functions are called by the
mapping  macros (last argument) . The above used naming scheme is not a
requirement,  however it is used in most applications using KOM.</para>

<sect2 id="Adopting">
<title>Adopting</title>

<para>You should use adopting whenever you want to hold a reference to an object and
want to be informed when the object dies in order to free all your references
to this object. But this should only be used when you're not the parent
object, meaning you didn't reference the object directly via the KOM reference
counter.  When using adopting you should re-implement the <literal remap="tt">leaveNotify</literal>
(and perhaps <literal remap="tt">adoptNotify</literal>) methods of your  object (and don't forget
to call the original KOMBase method!) .</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="KOMreferencing">
<title>KOM referencing</title>

<para>KOM reference counting should be used to "express" that you possess the
object. This gives you direct control over the lifecycle of the object by
letting the reference counter act directly on the server object, in contrary
to CORBA reference counting, where the reference counter only acts on the stub
object, in case of remote objects (this is different for local objects, where
stub = server object) . When the KOM reference counter drops down to zero the
object gets destroyed. This destruction is done by calling <literal remap="tt">cleanUp()</literal>,
which closes all connections to other objects and leaves all relatives.  After
this call is finished the object truly gets released. You might want to
re-implement the <literal remap="tt">cleanUp()</literal> method. In this case make sure that you
don't forget two things:</para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>only execute if the boolean variable <literal remap="tt">m&lowbar;bIsClean</literal> is false,
otherwise simply return</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>make sure you call the previous implementation!</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>As a short summary to this KOM reference stuff just keep in mind, that
there are three ways to hold a reference to an object:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>you're connected to the object via signals/slots or via event filters</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>you're the parent object, meaning you hold a reference through the KOM
reference counter</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>otherwise you should use adopting to get informed whenever the object wants
to die, in order to free all references to the object which are not of
one of the above kinds. The idea behind all this is that all
connections/references between objects are symmetric, meaning
<emphasis remap="bf">both</emphasis> sides know about the connection and <emphasis remap="bf">both</emphasis> sides
clean up all connections between each other whenever one of the two
objects wants to die. In case of signal/slot connections this is done
automatically by KOM. In case of KOM reference counters you have the
direct control over the lifecylcle for the object. Adopting, as third
way, can be used to keep other connections symmetric, connections which
are neither signal/slot connections nor direct references via the KOM
reference counter.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>Hint: Using the <literal remap="tt">KOMVar</literal> template makes handling KOM references much
easier, they can be used similar to the CORBA &lowbar;var types.</para>

<sect2 id="THEcomponenttheKOMComponentKOMComponentinter">
<title>THE component - the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KOM::Component</primary></indexterm>KOM::Component interface</title>

<para>The Component interface, being derived from the Base interface, additionally
provides a kind of small interface repository for only this component,
combined with the possibility to provide new interfaces by dynamic aggregation
and a standard way to add plugin components. This gives CORBA objects the
possibility to enhance their functionality at run-time.</para>

<para>There are five kinds of interfaces:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Builtin Interfaces (derived Interfaces)</para>
</listitem>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Builtin Plugin Interfaces</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Dynamic Plugin Interfaces</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>Builtin interfaces are all interfaces the object directly implements. This
means they are part of the actual object implementation and can be specified
via the <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>ADD&lowbar;INTERFACE</literal></primary></indexterm>ADD&lowbar;INTERFACE</literal> macro (in <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>komComponent.h</literal></primary></indexterm>komComponent.h) . So for example if
your interface description looks like this:
<programlisting>module Foo
{
  interface MyInterface : AnotherInterface
  {
    ...
  };
};</programlisting>
</para>

<para>You should add the following line into the constructor of an implementation of
this interface:
<indexterm><primary>IDL</primary></indexterm>
<programlisting>ConstructorNameOfMyInterface::ConstructorNameOfMyInterface( ... )
{
  ...
  ADD_INTERFACE( "IDL:Foo/MyInterface:1.0" );
  ...
}</programlisting>
</para>

<para>This way you tell your component that it supports the interface
"Foo/Interface" and therefore makes it available through the three functions
<literal remap="tt">getInterface()</literal>, <literal remap="tt">interfaces()</literal> and
<literal remap="tt">supportsInterface()</literal> .</para>

<para>Aggregates solve a problem with distributed objects, the problem of
derivation.  Since the implementation of an interface is completely
encapsulated there has to be another way to extend the functionality of an
already existing  object.  By using aggregate components you can add new
interfaces to an object,  at run-time. This means you extend the functionality
but you do not change the behaviour of the object itself.</para>
<sect3 id="BuiltinAggregates">

<para>The goals of the OpenParts technology, based upon KOM, are:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>provide an easy way to graphically embed other application's "widgets"</para>

<listitem>

</para>

<para>To simplify the act of understanding OpenParts I will give a short example
situation:</para>

<para>Imagine you have an a word processor and a formula editor, both being separate
applications. If you now want to insert a formula into your word processor
document by using your formula editor application this arises several
problems: You can of course embed the formula editor's main widget window via
swallowing by using XReparentWindow and friends, or easier by using QXEmbed.
But then how do you want to edit your formula without having access to the
formula editor's menubar / toolbar? In any way it would look ugly if these are
part of the formula window. Wouldn't it be nice if the menus / toolbars of
your word processor application would get replaced by the formula editor ones,
except for some general menu /toolbar items? And when you go back to your text
document the old menus / toolbars come back again.</para>

<para>Well, this is a perfect job for OpenParts :-) .</para>

<para>OpenParts solves the above described problem by introducing a new sytem of
visual components and a new way of creating shared GUI elements, such as menus
or toolbars, dynamically on demand.</para>

<para>In the implementation of OpenParts every element consists usually of two
classes, the interface implementation, where the class name ends with "If",
and the Qt/KDE object. So for example the OpenParts StatusBar element is
represented by two classes: <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OPStatusBar</literal></primary></indexterm>OPStatusBar</literal>, being derived from
<indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KStatusBar</literal></primary></indexterm>KStatusBar,  handles the Qt/KDE specific extensions, and
<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OPStatusBarIf</literal></primary></indexterm>OPStatusBarIf</literal> which is  responsible for providing an implementation
of the actual <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OpenPartsUI::StatusBar</literal></primary></indexterm>OpenPartsUI::StatusBar  interface by "translating" the interface
functionality into Qt/KDE function  calls.</para>

<para>Since every Qt/KDE object in OpenParts is most often bound to such an
interface, like described above, there is usually an interface() function
which returns a reference to the OpenParts interface of the element. In case
of the above example <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OPStatusBar::interface()</literal></primary></indexterm>OPStatusBar::interface()</literal> returns a reference to
an <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OPStatusBarIf</literal></primary></indexterm>OPStatusBarIf</literal> object which is directly bound to this
<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OPStatusBar</literal></primary></indexterm>OPStatusBar</literal> object.</para>

<title><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>QWidget</literal></primary></indexterm>QWidget as Component? - the OpenParts::Part interface</title>

<para>In OpenParts every window which has its own GUI and which is meant to be
displayed in a MainWindow is called a Part (just like the formula editor view
or the word processor document view in the above described example) , and
implements the <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OpenParts::Part</literal></primary></indexterm>OpenParts::Part interface by deriving from the class
<literal remap="tt">OPPartIf</literal>.</para>

<para>If you want to make a widget class a full-featured Part component then you
have to handle some things different than you might be used to, in regard to
the standard Qt/KDE widget framework. In fact now a widget is no more a simple
window in which you display some data, no, a Part is much more than this. In
particular a Part has, beside it's window (widget, which may of course contain
sub-windows or even other Parts (see <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OPFrame</literal></primary></indexterm>OPFrame</literal> documentation) ) a
full-featured GUI, consisting of a menubar with menus, toolbar(s) and a
statusbar.</para>

<para>The special thing with the GUI is the way it is created, handled/used and
"destroyed" . All this has to be highly dynamic because now the user decides
about which Part he wants to have active. OpenParts provides the basic
framework for this:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>it tells you when you have to create your GUI and provides you the necessary
references to the GUI related objects of OpenParts.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>it also tells you when the GUI is destructed.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>in addition you are notified when your Part gets the focus and gives you
the choice whether to accept or reject the focus.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>you are also notified when your Part gets registered to a MainWindow, in
order to register your component at several GUI servant objects, just
like the menubar manager for example.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>The very first step you have to make is to tell the OpenParts Part Interface
(<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OPPartIf</literal></primary></indexterm>OPPartIf</literal>) , the class you have to inherit from, what the actual
widget is, because <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OPartIf</literal></primary></indexterm>OPartIf</literal> does not inherit from QWidget. This gives
you the  flexibility to separate your Part component from your actualy widget,
but you  don't have to do this. You can simply multiply inherit from
<literal remap="tt">OPPartIf</literal> and <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>QWidget</literal></primary></indexterm>QWidget</literal> or the appropriate widget class. In any way you
specify your Part  widget by calling <literal remap="tt">setWidget( your&lowbar;widget&lowbar;here )</literal> .
In most cases, when  the Part component is the widget at the same time, you
simply call <literal remap="tt">setWidget( this )</literal> :-) . Make sure this call is done in
the constructor of your class!</para>

<para>The next important point is that you will want to re-implement the virtual
<literal remap="tt">init()</literal> function of <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OPPartIf</literal></primary></indexterm>OPPartIf</literal> . This is highly recommended
since this function is called after your Part got registered by a MainWindow.
The idea  behind this function is that at the time the constructor of a Part
gets executed, the Part itself is definitely not registered to a MainWindow,
yet. But in fact you need to know when your Part gets registered, in order to
register your Part at the GUI servant objects, which are only available via
the MainWindow's interface. A reference to the MainWindow is available through
the <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>m&lowbar;vMainWindow</literal></primary></indexterm>m&lowbar;vMainWindow</literal> variable, which will be automatically initialized
when the MainWindow  registration is done, so don't use this variable before
your <literal remap="tt">init()</literal> function gets called (<literal remap="tt">m&lowbar;vMainWindow</literal> will be nil
anyway) .</para>

<para>Now over to the details of the <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>init()</literal></primary></indexterm>init()</literal> function. Here you should place
all initialisation stuff which depends on being registered to a MainWindow.
In addition you can do the above mentioned registration at the GUI managing
objects. Usually this looks like the following example:
<programlisting>void MyPart::init()
{
  //register at the menubar manager if you want to use/display a menubar
  OpenParts::MenuBarManager_var menuBarManager = m_vMainWindow-&gt;menuBarManager();
  if ( !CORBA::is_nil( menuBarManager ) ) //check whether the shell window allows us to have a menubar
    menuBarManager-&gt;registerClient( id(), this ); //see chapter about the
              //*barManager objects
              //for further explanations

  //...the same with the toolbar
  OpenParts::ToolBarManager_var toolBarManager = m_vMainWindow-&gt;toolBarManager();
  if ( !CORBA::is_nil( toolBarManager ) )
    toolBarManager-&gt;registerClient( id(), this );

  //better define a class wide variable, of course
  OpenPartsUI::StatusBar_var m_vMyStatusBar;

  OpenParts::StatusBarManager_var statusBarManager = m_vMainWindow-&gt;statusBarManager();
  if ( !CORBA::is_nil( statusBarManager ) )
    m_vMyStatusBar = statusBarManager-&gt;registerClient( id() );
}</programlisting>
</para>

<para>Note that the registration calls for these three GUI element types are only
necessary if you really want to use them. For example if your Part does not
want to display any toolbar you should leave out the corresponding call.  In
addition you might come up with the situation that for example the
<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>toolBarManager()</literal></primary></indexterm>toolBarManager()</literal> call returns a nil reference, which indicates that
the MainWindow does not allow its Parts to have a toolbar. Obviously the same
applies for the menubar and the statusbar.</para>

<para>OpenParts makes use of KOM events to tell a Part about the
construction/destruction of it's GUI. These are in particular:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para><literal remap="tt">OpenPartsUI::eventCreateMenuBar</literal> ("OpenPartsUI/CreateMenuBar")</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

The attached argument is a <literal remap="tt">OpenPartsUI::MenuBar</literal></para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para><literal remap="tt">OpenPartsUI::eventCreateToolBar</literal> ("OpenPartsUI/CreateToolBar")</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

The attached argument is a <literal remap="tt">OpenPartsUI::ToolBarFactory</literal></para>

<para>Depending on whether a Part wants to display a menubar and/or toolbar, the
managing objects emit these two events to it. In regard to your implementation
this means that you have to re-implement the <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>event()</literal></primary></indexterm>event()</literal> function
(remember: A Part is a full-featured KOM Component) .</para>

<para>The attached event arguments indicate whether the toolbar(s) or the menubar
are to be created or cleared. Check these arguments against
<literal remap="tt">CORBA::is&lowbar;nil()</literal> and you know :-) .</para>

<para>The OpenParts StatusBar is handled different compared to the
MenuBar/ToolBar(s) . In fact it is easier: When registering at the OpenParts
StatusBarManager you receive your <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OpenParts::StatusBar</literal></primary></indexterm>OpenParts::StatusBar</literal> as return
value. You can then use the StatusBar everywhere in your Part, independend
from whether it is visible (active) or not.</para>

<para>In the <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>init()</literal></primary></indexterm>init()</literal> function a lot of registration stuff is done, and
corresponding to this in the <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>cleanUp()</literal></primary></indexterm>cleanUp()</literal> function (see chapter about
<indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KOM::Base</primary></indexterm>KOM::Base) you have to unregister from the GUI servant objects and free all
appropriate references, following KOM's model of symmetric references and
connections. Usually the code looks like this:
<programlisting>void MyPart::cleanUp()
{
  if ( m_bIsClean )
    return;

  //unregister our menubar
  OpenParts::MenuBarManager_var menuBarManager = m_vMainWindow-&gt;menuBarManager();
  if ( !CORBA::is_nil( menuBarManager ) )
    menuBarManager-&gt;unregisterClient( id() );

  //...the same with the toolbar
  OpenParts::ToolBarManager_var toolBarManager = m_vMainWindow-&gt;toolBarManager();
  if ( !CORBA::is_nil( toolBarManager ) )
    toolBarManager-&gt;unregisterClient( id() );

  OpenParts::StatusBarManager_var statusBarManager = m_vMainWindow-&gt;statusBarManager();
  if ( !CORBA::is_nil( statusBarManager ) )
    statusBarManager-&gt;unregisterClient( id() );

  //free other references here
  //...

  //this is IMPORTANT!!!
  //Always call the cleanUp() method of the base class when you're done!
  OPPartIf::cleanUp();
}</programlisting>

<title>Part Children</title>

<para>A Part Child is a usual Part with three extra features:
<orderedlist><listitem>
<para>A Part Child has a Parent Part assigned.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>It does not have a GUI and it therefore does not receive any GUI creation
events.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The Parent Child receives events whenever there are any child related focus
changes. Since the Part Child functionality is integrated in the
<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OpenParts::Part</literal></primary></indexterm>OpenParts::Part</literal> interface and it's implementation,
<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OPPartIf</literal></primary></indexterm>OPPartIf</literal>, you don't have to deal  with additional classes when
using Child Parts. Simply leave out the mapping of the OpenParts GUI
events in the Child Part and instead map the Child Part events described
below and assign the Parent Part via <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>setParent()</literal></primary></indexterm>setParent()</literal>. See the
interface description of <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OpenParts::Part</literal></primary></indexterm>OpenParts::Part</literal> , in <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>openparts.idl</literal></primary></indexterm>openparts.idl,

<sect2 id="HowtoembedaParttheOPFrameOPFrameclass">
<title>How to embed a Part - the <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OPFrame</literal></primary></indexterm>OPFrame class</title>

<para>Now that you know how to create full-featured Part components it is still
unexplained how Parts are really displayed/shown. Since Parts are no simple
QWidgets but CORBA objects we need a helping hand here, which is the
<literal remap="tt">OPFrame</literal> class. In fact <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OPFrame</literal></primary></indexterm>OPFrame</literal> is a <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>QWidget</literal></primary></indexterm>QWidget, but in
conjuction with Qt's <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>QXEmbed</literal></primary></indexterm>QXEmbed it embeds the Part's widget window. The usage of
<literal remap="tt">OPFrame</literal> is really easy, usually the code looks like this:</para>

<para><programlisting>... somewhere in an application's widget ...
myFrame = new OPFrame( the_parent_widget );
myFrame-&gt;attach( a_reference_to_the_part_we_want_to_embed );
myFrame-&gt;show();</programlisting>
</para>

<para>In addition to the above example you can <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>detach()</literal></primary></indexterm>detach()</literal> your Part, which
you should usually do on exit. Just have a look at <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>opFrame.h</literal></primary></indexterm>opFrame.h, it is
documented.</para>

<para>One last important thing you have to know about <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OPFrame</literal></primary></indexterm>OPFrame</literal> is that this
class internally uses KOM referencing (using a <literal remap="tt">KOMVar</literal> variable) to
hold the Part.  This means that there are two possible situations when using
<literal remap="tt">OPFrame</literal> :</para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>If the embedding Widget/Object uses KOM referencing as well to keep a
reference to the Part then there are two objects influencing the Part's
lifecycle. On the one hand there's the <literal remap="tt">OPFrame</literal> which
increases/decreases the Part's KOM reference counter when it gets
attached/detached, and on the other hand there's the embedding
Widget/Object. So make sure that you know when you free your KOM
reference to the Part in regard to detaching the Part!</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If the embedding Widget/Object does not use KOM referencing then you have
to know that when detaching the Part it automatically gets destroyed,
since usually the <literal remap="tt">OPFrame</literal> is the only object holding a KOM
reference  to the Part and the KOM reference counter therefore drops
down to zero and issues the complete destruction of the object.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="ThecenterofOpenPartstheOpenPartsMainWindowin">
<title>The center of OpenParts - the OpenParts::MainWindow interface</title>

<para>Another important component is the so called <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OpenParts::MainWindow</literal></primary></indexterm>OpenParts::MainWindow, being
derived from a <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KTMainWindow</literal></primary></indexterm>KTMainWindow in the implementation (and therefore the top-level
window of your application) and being the shell around visible sub-windows and
shared GUI elements.</para>

<para>The MainWindow's functionality is extended by some builtin aggregates, the
managing objects for the menu-/tool-/statusbar. These objects are either
available directly via the <literal remap="tt">*barManager()</literal> methods of the MainWindow's
interface or indirectly by being aggregates and therefore available via the
components interface repository (<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>getInterface()</literal></primary></indexterm>getInterface()</literal>,
<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>supportsInterface()</literal></primary></indexterm>supportsInterface()</literal>, ...) .</para>

<para>A Part can only be displayed in a MainWindow and the MainWindow has to know
about this. So before you can display a Part you have to register it to the
MainWindow. This is done by calling the Part Interface's
<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>setMainWindow()</literal></primary></indexterm>setMainWindow()</literal> method (see previous chapter for further information
about the process of registration) and this will give the Part a unique ID
(which is for example used when addressing the part's GUI via the *bar manager
objects) .</para>

<para>The MainWindow, as shell, has full control over all shared GUI elements.  This
means that it is responsible for
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>creating the appropriate *bar managing objects</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>providing a skeleton/standard GUI which is meant to be always present,
no matter what Part is active</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>telling the GUI managing objects to activate/deactivate a Part's GUI</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>The creation of the *bar managers can be easily done by simply performing a
dummy call to <literal remap="tt">*barManager()</literal> which usually returns a pointer to the
appropriate manager and also creates a new one if it does not exist yet. It is
recommended to perform these calls in the constructor of your MainWindow.</para>

<para>The creation/handling of the skeleton GUI is explained later in the chapters
about <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OPMenu</literal></primary></indexterm>OPMenu(Bar)/<indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OPToolBar</literal></primary></indexterm>OPToolBar .</para>

<para>Your MainWindow emits a Qt signal (<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>activePartChanged</literal></primary></indexterm>activePartChanged</literal>) which informs
you about a focus change of the active part, meaning whenever the user clicks
on a non-active Part and it accepts the focus. Beside the pure informative
sense  of this signal it is recommended to connect to this signal and perform
the  following two steps in the slot implementation:</para>

<para><orderedlist><listitem>
<para>deactivate the previous active Part's GUI by calling the *bar managers
<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>clear()</literal></primary></indexterm>clear()</literal> function, which will do the job and, beside some
internal stuff, emit the GUI events (see previous chapter) to the Part.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>activate the new active Part's GUI by calling the *bar managers
<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>create()</literal></primary></indexterm>create()</literal> function, which will, similar to the activation, emit
events to the Part. This is not really required but it is highly
recommended. The following code is usually used for this:

<programlisting>      void NameOfYourMainWindow::slotActivePartChanged( unsigned long old_id,
                                                        unsigned long new_id )
      {
        // clear the menu/tool/statusbar(s)
        menuBarManager()-&gt;clear();
        toolBarManager()-&gt;clear();
        statusBarManager()-&gt;clear();
        // create the new Part's GUI
        menuBarManager()-&gt;create( new_id );
        toolBarManager()-&gt;create( new_id );
        statusBarManager()-&gt;create( new_id );
      }
      </programlisting>
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<para>Now that the MainWindow handles all the shared "stuff" there is one thing
which was not mentioned in this documentation, yet: What about the
MainWindow's caption? The OpenParts MainWindow interface allows parts to have
their own window captions, but how does OpenParts handle this?</para>

<para>Well, there are two ways:
<orderedlist><listitem>
<para><literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OPMainWindow</literal></primary></indexterm>OPMainWindow</literal> provides you a so called <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>AutoCaption</literal></primary></indexterm>AutoCaption</literal> mode
which automatically changes the MainWindow's caption whenever the active
part changes. This is enabled by default.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>But sometimes the shell wants to have full control over the window's
caption, and this is accomplished by disabling the <literal remap="tt">AutoCaption</literal>
mode, which  leads to the situation that the window's caption is not
changed by OpenParts  in any way but instead gives you control over it.</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="AccesssharedGUIelementsthroughCORBAOpenParts">
<title>Access shared GUI elements through CORBA - OpenPartsUI and its interfaces</title>

<para>Well, now that we know when we have to construct/destruct a Part's GUI,
via the <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OpenPartsUI</literal></primary></indexterm>OpenPartsUI events, we have to learn how to really create it, because
we don't have the common <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KMenuBar</literal></primary></indexterm>KMenuBar, <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KToolBar</literal></primary></indexterm>KToolBar, etc. classes anymore available.
The replacement for them are CORBA Objects, described in openparts&lowbar;ui.idl which
is, together with the corresponding implementations, a part of the partsui
module. The interfaces are 98&percnt;; similar to the KDE/Qt classes, so they're
quite easy to use. Instead of bloating up this documentation with example code
I rather suggest reading the tutorials in kdelibs/corba/tutorials .</para>

<para>Toolbars and menus are usually beautified with pixmaps, using QPixmap classes.
As we now use a CORBA interface to access our GUI elements, <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>QPixmap</literal></primary></indexterm>QPixmap has become
<indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OpenPartsUI::Pixmap</literal></primary></indexterm>OpenPartsUI::Pixmap for OpenParts applications. OpenPartsUI::Pixmap is just
a "stringified" QPixmap, and opUIUtils.(h,cc) contains some easy
to use conversion routines.</para>

<para>In addition OPUIUtils contains string conversion routines between CORBA::WChar*
and <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>QString</literal></primary></indexterm>QString. This is necessary since Qt version &gt;=2.0 supports <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>Unicode</literal></primary></indexterm>Unicode,
via QString, all over the place, and obviously GUI elements like menus or
toolbars have been converted to support this. OpenParts has been converted,
too, by using "wstring" (<indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>CORBA::WChar *</literal></primary></indexterm>CORBA::WChar *) in the interfaces and by
using and providing conversion routines. These routines are static member
functions of the OPUIUtils  class, just like with the pixmap conversion. To
simplify the usage, two macros have been defined: <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>Q2C</literal></primary></indexterm>Q2C</literal> and
<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>C2Q</literal></primary></indexterm>C2Q</literal> . The first one converts a QString into a CORBA::WChar * string
and the second one vice-versa.</para>

<para>When converting from QString to CORBA::WChar * the conversion routine
allocates memory. To avoid <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>memory leaks</primary></indexterm>memory leaks it is highly recommended to use
CORBA::WString&lowbar;var variables. Exactly the same applies for QPixmap -&gt;
OpenPartsUI::Pixmap conversions: Use <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>OpenPartsUI::Pixmap&lowbar;var</literal></primary></indexterm>OpenPartsUI::Pixmap&lowbar;var , and you don't
have to worry about leaks :-) .</para>

<para>Here's some example code, to show how to do it right:
<programlisting>    ...
    OpenPartsUI::Pixmap_var pm = OPUIUtils::convertPixmap( QPixmap_variable_here );
    someToolBar-&gt;insertButton( pm, ... );
    ...
    //use the same pm variable again
    pm = OPUIUtils::convertPixmap( another_qpixmap );
    ...</programlisting>
</para>

<para>Similar things have to be done with QString's:</para>

<para><programlisting>    ...
    CORBA::WString_var text = Q2C( QString_here );
    someMenuBar-&gt;insertItem7( text, ... );
    ...
    // or you can write:
    someMenuBar-&gt;insertItem7( ( text = Q2C( QString_here ) ) , ...);
    ...</programlisting>
</para>

<para>One note left: When you return a "wide string" (CORBA::WChar *) as
a function result by using <literal remap="tt">Q2C</literal>, make sure not to use
<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>CORBA::wstring&lowbar;dup()</literal></primary></indexterm>CORBA::wstring&lowbar;dup()</literal>.</para>

<para>Example:
<programlisting>  return CORBA::string_dup( Q2C( QString_here ) ); //!!!! WRONG!!!!!
  ...
  return Q2C( QString_here ); // RIGHT! because Q2C already allocates the string</programlisting>

<para>Before we can use any of <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kded</literal></primary></indexterm>kded's services, we have to know something about it's
"position" in the KDE and the way it itself and the services can be accessed.</para>

<para>The first two points are fixed for all clients, the third one depends on the
specific client. In general you have to choices:</para>

<para>If your application already uses <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KOM</primary></indexterm>KOM, then you're fine with using
<indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KOMApplication</literal></primary></indexterm>KOMApplication (as you need it anyway) .</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If you don't want to use <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KOM</primary></indexterm>KOM, then you can initialize the ORBA "manually":
<literal remap="verb">CORBA::ORB_ptr orb = CORBA::ORB_init( argc, argv, "mico-local-orb" );</literal>
Please note that when using this construct or similar ones, your application is
<emphasis remap="bf">not</emphasis> able to act as <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>CORBA server</primary></indexterm>CORBA server if you are using KDE/Qt classes at the
same time. This is due to the fact that the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>ORB</primary></indexterm>ORB needs it's own event loop, beside
the main Qt event loop. Currently only <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KOMApplication</literal></primary></indexterm>KOMApplication, as part of the KDE Object
Model, implements the needed functionality to combine both event loops and thus
making KDE apps able to serve CORBA Objects.</para>

<para>Although <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kded</literal></primary></indexterm>kded uses CORBA extensively, the API is kept simple and free from
complicated CORBA stuff. In fact when talking about <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kded</literal></primary></indexterm>kded and it's API not the
<indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kded server</literal></primary></indexterm>kded server is meant but the KDE Daemon library. This library contains the
interface to the server (for the clients) as well as the whole server functionality.
The reason for this is based on the idea that an application using <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kded</literal></primary></indexterm>kded should
not be forced to rely on an existing <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kded server</literal></primary></indexterm>kded server binary nor a running server at
all. The following three situations may exist when a client app gets started:</para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>No <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kded</literal></primary></indexterm>kded is running and there's no <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kded server</literal></primary></indexterm>kded server binary in the path. In this
situation <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>libkded</literal></primary></indexterm>libkded will automatically start a local instance of <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kded</literal></primary></indexterm>kded in
the application's process.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>No <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kded</literal></primary></indexterm>kded is running but there's a <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kded server</literal></primary></indexterm>kded server binary available. Here <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>libkded</literal></primary></indexterm>libkded
will start the kded executable and connect to it.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kded</literal></primary></indexterm>kded is already running :-) . The fact that a <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kded</literal></primary></indexterm>kded is running is indicated
by a special property on the X Root Window. <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kded</literal></primary></indexterm>kded publishes it's <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>IOR</primary></indexterm>IOR
(Interoperable Object Reference) in this property. This also ensures that
a <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>kded</primary></indexterm>kded instance is specific to a X display and therefore to your KDE session.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>To sum it up: <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>libkded</primary></indexterm>libkded will always make sure that the services of <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>kded</primary></indexterm>kded are available
for your client application, no matter in what alien environment the app is
running :-) . And, although you don't have to care about this, you can optionally
control this behaviour of <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>libkded</primary></indexterm>libkded by adding one of the following three <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>commandline arguments</primary></indexterm>commandline arguments
to your app:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>"-kdedlocal" , which will make <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>libkded</primary></indexterm>libkded <emphasis remap="bf">always</emphasis> start a process-local
instance of kded and it's services.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>"-kdedremote" , which will make <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>libkded</primary></indexterm>libkded try to look for a running <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>kded</primary></indexterm>kded
instance before starting a local one.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>"-kdedior ior&lowbar;here" , which will make <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>libkded</primary></indexterm>libkded connect to the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>kded server</primary></indexterm>kded server
specified by the given <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>IOR</primary></indexterm>IOR.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>Your actual interface to <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>kded</primary></indexterm>kded and it's services is the <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KdedInstance</literal></primary></indexterm>KdedInstance</literal> class,
defined in kded&lowbar;instance.h . So if you want to use <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>kded</primary></indexterm>kded (I guess that's why you're
reading this shit ;) ) then make sure to create <emphasis remap="bf">one</emphasis> single instance
of it, preferably by adding the following line somewhere in the beginning of
your <literal remap="tt">main()</literal> :
<literal remap="verb">KdedInstance( argc, argv, _a_reference_to_the_orb_here_ );</literal>
If you're using <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KOMApplication</primary></indexterm>KOMApplication as application object (make sure to create the
instance before this line) , then you're fine by specifying <literal remap="tt">komapp&lowbar;orb</literal> as
reference to the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>ORB</primary></indexterm>ORB.</para>

<para>As there is always only one single instance of this class, you can simply access
it by the static <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>self()</literal></primary></indexterm>self()</literal> method of the class from anywhere you want. No
need to pass <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KdedInstance</literal></primary></indexterm>KdedInstance arguments all around in your program ;-) .</para>

<para>For further information about <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KdedInstance</literal></primary></indexterm>KdedInstance</literal> you might want to read
<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>kded&lowbar;instance.h</literal></primary></indexterm>kded&lowbar;instance.h</literal> , it's pretty good documented.</para>

<sect1 id="KTraderKTrader">
<title><indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KTrader</primary></indexterm>KTrader</title>

<para>As already mentioned in the introduction, <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KTrader</primary></indexterm>KTrader gives you access to the registry.
"Now what the hell is the registry?" you might ask. As this is just a documentation
about <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>kded</primary></indexterm>kded/<indexterm remap="idx"><primary>libkded</primary></indexterm>libkded, I can only respond: "Please consult the documentation of/in
<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>libkio</literal></primary></indexterm>libkio</literal> for more information" :-&rcub; . Just one thing about it here: <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KTrader</primary></indexterm>KTrader loads
the whole and bloaty registry for you. Thanks to the magic of <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>libkio</literal></primary></indexterm>libkio</literal> the loaded
registry will always be in sync with the "real" registry, the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>.desktop</primary></indexterm>.desktop files in
the following standard directories (both types, the system wide and the user ones) :

</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>services</para>

<listitem>
<para>servicetypes</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>Now over to <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KTrader</primary></indexterm>KTrader and it's API. Similar to <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KdedInstance</literal></primary></indexterm>KdedInstance</literal> there can
be only one single instance. The difference is that you don't have to care
about allocating it, just simply get a reference to the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KTrader</primary></indexterm>KTrader by calling
the <literal remap="tt">ktrader()</literal> method of <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KdedInstance</literal></primary></indexterm>KdedInstance</literal> . And: don't
even think about deleting the returned reference! Just simply use it and be
happy with it :-) . (hey, <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>kded</primary></indexterm>kded is designed to be easy to use, no need for difficult
stuff...)</para>

<para>The <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KTrader</primary></indexterm>KTrader API is even so simple that it contains only two methods ;-) . But
before I describe these methods you have to know something about the kind of
data <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KTrader</primary></indexterm>KTrader returns. In simple words: You will always get a list of <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KService</primary></indexterm>KService
objects. More detailed: The returned list is a <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>QValueList</literal></primary></indexterm>QValueList</literal> and the
entries are <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KSharedPtr</literal></primary></indexterm>KSharedPtr</literal>'s (FIXME: will soon be renamed to QSharedPtr,
as it will become part of Qt.... AFAIK) to <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KService</primary></indexterm>KService</literal> objects. Please
read the corresponding Qt documentation about these two classes. The big advantage
of using these two template classes is that everything becomes easy for you
and that the memory consumption is kept at a minimum . You don't have to care
about pointers, freeing them and cleaning up the list, as long as you use
<literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KTrader::ServicePtr</literal></primary></indexterm>KTrader::ServicePtr</literal> variables to hold the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KService</primary></indexterm>KService objects and as
long as you use <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KTrader::OfferList</literal></primary></indexterm>KTrader::OfferList</literal> to pass the list around in your
program. So: Remember to always use these two types when dealing with <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KTrader</primary></indexterm>KTrader!</para>

<para>Now over to the two methods.</para>

<para><literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KTrader::listServices()</literal></primary></indexterm>KTrader::listServices()</literal> returns your a list of <emphasis remap="bf">all</emphasis> available
services in the whole KDE. (no need for further explanations I think...)</para>

<para><literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KTrader::query()</literal></primary></indexterm>KTrader::query()</literal> is the key method of this beast. It performs a lookup
in the registry database, given your information about what you want to have.
The first argument is the name of the servicetype which all returned services
must implement. If you're unsure about the word "servicetype" , then you can
replace it with "mimetype" , for most, but not all, cases.</para>

<para>The second argument is an additional constraint expression, which has to be
fulfilled by a service.</para>

<para>The third argument is a preference expression after which the returned services
will be sorted. The value of the expression has to be numeric.</para>

<para>The syntax of these two expressions is equal with the language of the standard
CORBA Trader (this is due to the fact that the parsing code is from the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>COS</primary></indexterm>COS
Trader of <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>MICO</primary></indexterm>MICO) . The language is not very difficult and I don't want to bloat
this documentation with further explanations about it. Please consult your
CORBA literature for more information. Just one thing you have to know:
Comparisons are always done with the properties of the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KService</primary></indexterm>KService object,
which are the standard entries (Name, ServiceType, RepoIds, ...) plus
the ones specified in the servicetype declaration and read by <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KService</primary></indexterm>KService.</para>

<para>Well, after so much theoretical explanations it's time for some practical example
code:
<indexterm remap="ncdx"><primary><literal>KTrader::OfferList</literal></primary></indexterm>
<programlisting>  ...
  //get a reference to the KTrader
  KTrader *trader = KdedInstance::self()-&gt;ktrader();

  ...
  //will return a list of all services which implement the servicetype
  //named "text/plain"
  KTrader::OfferList offers = trader-&gt;query( "text/plain" );


  ...
  //will return a list of all services which implement the servicetype
  //named "image/gif" and which have the AllowAsDefault property set true
  KTrader::OfferList offers = trader-&gt;query( "image/gif", "AllowAsDefault == TRUE" );

  ...
  //will return KSpread ;-)
  KTrader::OfferList offers = trader-&gt;query( "KOfficeDocument", "(Exec == 'kspread') and (Path != '/opt/gnome/bin')" );

  ...
  //will return a list of all services which implement the servicetype
  //named "BlahFoo" and which will be sorted (from lowest to highest) by
  //the value of the property "Price" , declared in the servicetype
  //declaration of BlahFoo.
  KTrader::OfferList offers = trader-&gt;query( "BlahFoo", QString::null, "min Price" );</programlisting>
</para>

<para>Please note that <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KTrader</primary></indexterm>KTrader, since it queries <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>libkio</literal></primary></indexterm>libkio</literal> for services, will
always return services sorted by the user's preferences for the specific
servicetype. These preferences can be specified in the file "profilerc" .</para>

<title>KTraderServiceProvider</title>

<para>This section requires to be familiar with <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>libkio</literal></primary></indexterm>libkio</literal> and it is meant for everybody who
wants to use <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KRun</primary></indexterm>KRun in his application.</para>

<para><indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KRun</primary></indexterm>KRun requires a fully loaded registry in order to resolve mimetype &lt;-&gt; application
bindings. A fully loaded registry means that you need a <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KServiceTypeFactory</literal></primary></indexterm>KServiceTypeFactory</literal> and
a KServiceFactory, which both load the appropriate <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KServiceType</literal></primary></indexterm>KServiceType</literal><literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KService</literal></primary></indexterm>KService</literal> objects.
Now the KServiceType information doesn't need that much memory, but the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KService</primary></indexterm>KService
object really eat loooots of it. And isn't it kind of stupid to load this information
if this is already done by <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>kded</primary></indexterm>kded? Yes, it is ;-) .</para>

<para>What we would need is to make <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KRun</primary></indexterm>KRun query <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KTrader</primary></indexterm>KTrader for <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KService</primary></indexterm>KService data, instead of
directly using <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KServiceTypeProfile</primary></indexterm>KServiceTypeProfile. Fortunately <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KRun</primary></indexterm>KRun is flexible enough for this,
we just need a re-implementation of the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KServiceProvider</primary></indexterm>KServiceProvider, defined in <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>krun.h</literal></primary></indexterm>krun.h</literal>
and used by <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KRun</primary></indexterm>KRun. Guess what, but <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KTrader</primary></indexterm>KTrader provides you this re-implementation :-) .
Just have a look at the end of <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>ktrader.h</literal></primary></indexterm>ktrader.h</literal>.</para>

<para>To sum it up: The following line makes <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KRun</primary></indexterm>KRun query <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>kded</primary></indexterm>kded, in your application:
<programlisting>  ...
  //place this somewhere BEFORE the first usage of KRun, preferable somewhere
  //in main()
  KTraderServiceProvider serviceProvider;
  ...</programlisting>

That's all, except that you <emphasis remap="bf">must</emphasis> have a <indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>KdedInstance</literal></primary></indexterm>KdedInstance in order to be

</sect1>

<sect1 id="KActivatorKActivator">
<title><indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KActivator</primary></indexterm>KActivator</title>

<para>One often mentioned problem, when talking about applications which provide
their services via CORBA, is how to start and access these services. Solutions
like making apps write the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>IOR</primary></indexterm>IOR of an object somewhere into a file in the
filesystem or similar approaches are just hacks ;-) . Better use <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KActivator</primary></indexterm>KActivator,
since it can automatically, on demand, start servers for you or use already
running ones. This is accomplished with the help of the mediators for <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>BOA/POA</primary></indexterm>BOA/POA
and the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>IMR</primary></indexterm>IMR (Implementation Repository), both provided by <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>MICO</primary></indexterm>MICO. Fortunately
you don't have to deal with IMR entries and the mediators.</para>

<para>Before you can use <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KActivator</primary></indexterm>KActivator to start a server for you, you have to register
the server's service. There are two possible ways, the last one is highly
recommended though:</para>

<para><itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Register and unregister it manually, by using the two corresponding
methods of the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KActivator</primary></indexterm>KActivator.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Go the smart way and provide the necessary information in a <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>.desktop</primary></indexterm>.desktop file.
Fortunately <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KService</primary></indexterm>KService supports the necessary properties, like repository
ids, activation mode and others.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>For the second point it's important that the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>.desktop</primary></indexterm>.desktop file is available for
<indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KRegistry</primary></indexterm>KRegistry, by placing it in a directory which gets scanned by the registry.
If your application has already a <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>.desktop</primary></indexterm>.desktop file in the applnk tree for example,
then you're fine with adding the necessary fields in there. Otherwise the
directory named "services" (either system-wide or user-local) is the best place
for it. If you provide the CORBA service information this way, then <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KActivator</primary></indexterm>KActivator
will automatically detect it and register it automatically at the IMR. This
means that it is immediately available for <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KActivator</primary></indexterm>KActivator and thus to your client app.
And since <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KRegistry</primary></indexterm>KRegistry is such a cool thing :-) , you can do all this even at
run-time, when <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>kded</primary></indexterm>kded is running. Just place the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>.desktop</primary></indexterm>.desktop file in one of the
right directories for it and <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KActivator</primary></indexterm>KActivator will update the IMR on-the-fly. The
same applies obviously for just deleted or modified <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>.desktop</primary></indexterm>.desktop files, which will
make <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KActivator</primary></indexterm>KActivator adjust the IMR. Now you might get the idea why this is the
preferred way :-)) .</para>

<para>Now that you know how to register CORBA services you will want to know how
to "access" it. <literal remap="tt">activateService()</literal> is your friend here. Simply pass
it the name of the service, the repository id of the server object and the
object's tag and it will return you a functional object reference. That's all :-)</para>

<para>Depending on the service's activation mode, <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KActivator</primary></indexterm>KActivator will either return a reference
to an already running server or it will start a new instance.</para>

<para>One note about the returned object reference: This is a virtual reference,
which means that that server object is started when the first call is invoked
on this reference, thus making your server get started "lazy", only on-demand.
But that's just additional information, you don't have to deal and know about
it at all. Just be happy with your functional object reference :-) .</para>

<para>Want some examples? Here we go:</para>

<para>This is how a <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>.desktop</primary></indexterm>.desktop file could look like, assuming that the commandline
"--server" starts the app in <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>CORBA server</primary></indexterm>CORBA server mode:
<programlisting>Name=MyApp
Exec=fooblah
CORBAExec=fooblah --server
X-KDE-RepoIds=IDL:Foo/Blah:1.0#MyFoo
X-KDE-ActivationMode=shared</programlisting>
</para>

<para>If <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KActivator</primary></indexterm>KActivator "gets" this file, it will register the service and then you're
able to do something like this:
<programlisting>  ...
  KActivator *activator = KdedInstance::self()-&gt;kactivator();
  ...
  CORBA::Object_var obj = activator-&gt;activateServer( "MyApp", "IDL:Foo/Blah:1.0", "MyFoo );
  ...</programlisting>
</para>

<para>The above example will either start a new fooblah instance or connect to a running
one.</para>

<para>For further information please have a look at the examples in kdelibs/corba/tutorials/kded .
The example application there registers the server manually via <literal remap="tt">registerService</literal> .</para>

<para>Please note: The server <emphasis remap="bf">has</emphasis> to be started by <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>kded</primary></indexterm>kded in order to make <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KActivator</primary></indexterm>KActivator
return a reference to a running one. Executing "fooblah" from somewhere else
will <emphasis remap="bf">not</emphasis> make <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KActivator</primary></indexterm>KActivator use it. This is a problem for persistent
servers like <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDesktop</primary></indexterm>KDesktop for example. But there's a solution available, just read
the next chapter about the KDE Naming Service :-) .</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="KNamingKNaming">
<title><indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KNaming</primary></indexterm>KNaming</title>

<para>The KDE Naming Service, <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KNaming</primary></indexterm>KNaming, is also a very simple service, but it's pretty
useful and in some cases a very nice solution to make a CORBA client connect to
a persistent <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>CORBA server</primary></indexterm>CORBA server.</para>

<para>With <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KNaming</primary></indexterm>KNaming you can bind a freely chooseable name to a CORBA object. And since
<indexterm remap="idx"><primary>kded</primary></indexterm>kded is system (session) wide available, your object becomes available for any
client which is able to connect to <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>kded</primary></indexterm>kded.</para>

<para>There's not much to explain here :-&rcub; , so I suggest having a look at the <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KNaming</primary></indexterm>KNaming
API, in <literal remap="tt"><indexterm remap="cdx"><primary><literal>knaming.h</literal></primary></indexterm>knaming.h</literal>.</para>

<para>Example code can be, again, found in kdelibs/corba/tutorials/kded . Here's just
a short real example situation:</para>

<para>Just think of <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDesktop</primary></indexterm>KDesktop, that nice app providing your background desktop icons.
It provides some functionality via CORBA, just have a look at kdesktop.idl to
see what I'm talking about. Now the problem for <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDesktop</primary></indexterm>KDesktop is: How can it provide
this service to other apps in the system? Writing an <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>IOR</primary></indexterm>IOR into some file is no
clean solution IMHO, and using <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KActivator</primary></indexterm>KActivator doesn't work because <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDesktop</primary></indexterm>KDesktop does not
get started by <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>kded</primary></indexterm>kded but by the startkde script on KDE startup. So we find a better
way and make <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDesktop</primary></indexterm>KDesktop register it's object at <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KNaming</primary></indexterm>KNaming. This is done by the following
lines:
<programlisting>  ...
  KNaming *knaming = KdedInstance::self()-&gt;knaming();
  naming-&gt;bind( "KDesktop", kdesktop_object_here );
  ...</programlisting>

Well, I told you a lie ;) : <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KNaming</primary></indexterm>KNaming does not really bind to "<indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDesktop</primary></indexterm>KDesktop" but
instead to "IDL:KDesktopIf:1.0" , but since there's no naming convention
for the naming I have choosen a more readable name, IMHO of course :-) (don't
mind me David :] ) . I personally prefer human readable names ;) , in contrary
to repository ids with tags.</para>

<para>Back to <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KNaming</primary></indexterm>KNaming and <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDesktop</primary></indexterm>KDesktop: Now any client application, kfmclient for example,
can "connect" to <indexterm remap="idx"><primary>KDesktop</primary></indexterm>KDesktop. Just like this:
<programlisting>  ..
  KNaming *knaming = KdedInstance::self()-&gt;knaming();
  ...
  CORBA::Object_var obj = knaming-&gt;resolve( "KDesktop" );
  KDesktopIf_var kdesky = KDesktopIf::_narrow( obj );
  kdesky-&gt;selectAll(); //let's confuse the user by selecting all icons ;-)
  ...</programlisting>

<para>Common Object Request Broker Architecture, standard introduced by the OMG for distributed components that can be used
independently of platform, implementation and operating system. CORBA itself is only the standard which requires a corresponding
