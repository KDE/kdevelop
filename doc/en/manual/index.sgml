<chapt>Introduction
<p>

As everything on earth has it's fashions, today's computer world seems to tend more to the use of free software even for
commercial purpose. The most popular free software project is Linux. It is now generally agreed that Linux, (as well as other projects
such as the Apache web server, the Perl language and GNU suite of tools), proves that free software can be of as high a quality as
commercial software. But despite the quality, end users must still suffer under the cryptic commands of any Unix Systems.For Linux to
thrive, it needs applications, both free and commercial, and ease of use.

The <idx/KDE/ project tries to close this gap by providing an easy to use desktop and the companion libraries to extend the variety of
available <idx/GUI/-based software. But especially as free software is often made in the author's free time, the question for many
programmers is how much they like the current code development environment. KDevelop wants to take another major step: making the
programmer's life easier and more efficient: products created with KDevelop can reach a higher level of reliability and functionality
in the same development period.

To fulfill this goal, the KDevelop Integrated Development Environment provides many features that developers need as well as it
wraps the functionality of third party projects such as <tt/make/ and the GNU C++ <idx/Compiler/s and makes them an invisible, integrated
part of the development process. KDevelop manages:

<itemize>
<item> All development tools needed for C++ programming like <idx/Compiler/, <idx/Linker/, <idx/automake/ and
<idx/autoconf/,
<item> <idx/KAppWizard/, which generates complete, ready-to-go sample applications,
<item> Classgenerator, for creating new <idx/classes/ and integrating them into the current project,
<item> File management for sources, headers, documentation etc. to be included in the project,
<item> The creation of User-Handbooks written with <idx/SGML/ and the automatic generation of <idx/HTML/-<idx/output/ with the KDE look and feel,
<item> Automatic <idx/HTML/-based <idx/API-documentation/ for your project's <idx/classes/ with cross-references to the used libraries,
<item> Internationalization support for your application, allowing translators to easily add their target language to a project,
<item> creation of user interfaces by interaction with TrollTech큦 Qt Designer,
<item> managing your project via CVS by providing an easy-to-use frontend for the most needed functions,
<item> Debugging your application with a debugger of your choice, either the internal KDevelop debugge, ddd or kdbg,
<item> Editing of project-specific <idx/pixmaps/ with <idx/KIconEdit/,
<item> The inclusion of any other program you need for development by adding it to the "<idx/Tools/"-menu according to your individual needs.
</itemize>


KDevelop makes it a joy to work with all programs in one place and saves time by automating standard development processes
as well as giving you direct and transparent access to all information you need. The integrated browsing mechanisms are designed
to support <idx/documentation/ requests that developers have in conjunction with their project.

The <idx/class viewer/ and error finder bring you anywhere in the project code with a mouse click without needing to search for files;
File trees give direct access to the <idx/project files/ and the integrated help system offers superb access to online-documentation from
anywhere within the IDE.

<sect>Changes
<p>
Version 1.4 of KDevelop comes along with the most needed facilities for C/C++ development. During the development phase of KDevelop,
the project made great improvements since the 1.0 final release, followed by the release of version 1.1 and 1.2., the version line based on the KDE 1.x and Qt 1.4x libraries
finished with version 1.3 in late December of 2000. The current version is a port of version 1.3 to KDE 2.1 with enhanced features.

Improvements were made in the following sections:

<bf>KDevelop 1.2:</bf>
<itemize>
<item>fast classparser and -browser with graphical class-tree view and dialog-based adding of members and classes,
<item>CVS support for most needed functions such as adding, removing, updating and committing files and directories,
<item>updated and extended documentation, now covering five handbooks shipping with KDevelop,
<item>bugfixed dialogeditor and errorfinder,
<item>updated documentation tree which lets you access the class documentation up to any method of classes
directly
</itemize>

<bf>KDevelop 1.3:</bf>

<itemize>
<item>rewritten templates for Qt 2.x, now based on Qt-2.2.1 only as they make use of the QAction
class and the configure script searches
for the <bf>uic</bf> which processes Qt Designer files
<item>rewritten templates for KDE 2.0 which make use of the new API now fully and who are also
using the uic for desinger files
<item>support for the new <bf>Qt Designer</bf> in KDE 2.0/Qt-2.2.x projects.
<item>the new <bf>Qt Linguist</bf> and its tools coming with it to create internationalization files
for Qt applications is fully supported. The handling of internationalization is done the same way as
for KDE project with KDevelop, just that you have to use tr() instead of i18(). Create an example Qt
application to see the details. Also mind that all Qt utilities have to be in your $PATH variable,
usually this is $QTDIR/bin.
<item>all KDE 2.0 and Qt 2.2.x templates make use of KDE큦
autoconf/automake system, this enables developers to convert their automatic configuration system to
KDE easily if they decide to use KDE features for their application.
<item>KDevelop ships with three additional scripts to make your life easier; these are installed in
$prefix/bin (usually $KDEDIR/bin):
	<itemize>
	<item><bf>extractrc:</bf> this is a script that is originally located in the KDE CVS module kdesdk
(KDE Software Development Kit). It is called automatically for creating the pot-file of your
application and extracts the strings from your XML resource file that is used to build the GUI in
KDE 2.0 applications
	<item><bf>kimport:</bf> kimport is a perl script that enables you to create a *.kdevprj (KDevelp
Project File) from almost any automake/autoconf compatible already existing project. Usage: go to
your project directory and call kimport &gt; &lt;yourprojectname&gt;.kdevprj. This will redirect the
output to a projectfile that you can load into KDevelop.
	<item><bf>kdevdlg2ui:</bf> converts an existing *.kdevdlg file that has been created with
KDevelop큦 Dialogeditor into a *.ui file that can be edited with Qt큦 Designer.
	</itemize>
<item>several bugfixes regarding bugs in the
kwrite code and KDevelop itself </itemize>

<bf>KDevelop 1.4:</bf>

<itemize>
<item>porting over to KDE 2.1. KDevelop is now a true KDE 2.x application and ships with KDE 2.1
<item>removal of KDE 1.x templates and the internal dialogeditor. Graphical user interface design is now based on using Qt Designer only.
<item>improved functionality in regards to the classbrowser such as providing the "grep" function over the class-tree and autocompletion in the browser toolbar
that allows easy selection of classes, methods and member attributes as well as global functions, attributes and structs.
<item>overall GUI enhancements like geometry-managed dialogs; usage of KDE 2큦 new dialog classes and dockwidgets.
</itemize>

<bf>KDevelop 2.0:</bf>
<itemize>
<item>New configuration file *.kdevses, which holds user specific session information. Makes it a lot
easier to work in teams on the same source code.
<item>added manpage display
<item>new User Interface modes (Toplevel Mode, ChildFrame Mode)
<item>CTags support. Source Code can now be parsed so navigation is a lot easier now. You can easily switch 
between declaration and definition of Symbols as well as change between the corresponding Source / Header files
by pressing F12 or via the right mouse button menu.
<item>Output from Tools can now be displayed in messages window.
<item>The Grep Dialog remembers the last search items and search paths.
<item>KDevelop now send system notifications when a build has succeeded or failed. They do not trigger an action
by default, but you can assign a sound or a messagebox in the preferences menu.
<item>Many more usability improvements.
</itemize>

Any comments about the IDE, its documentation or feature requests are welcome.

For programming beginners and new users of this product we recommend to read yourself into this manual before starting to actually
work with the IDE as it covers the usage in depth. The understanding of how things are done the quickest way will save you a lot
of time searching for functions and features as it will enable you to make use of first-class development tools even more simple.

<sect>About the KDevelop Project
<p>
The KDevelop project was started in summer of 1998 after KDE 1.0 was available on Linux/Unix to make the
attempt of creating an easy to use C/C++ IDE for programmers, especially targeting on the KDE desktop. Since
then the project has found a lot of helpers and supporters as well as sponsors who want to help the team
continue their work on this now widely recognized programming environment. Within one and a half year, the IDE
developed to a full-featured KDE application with the most possible functionality and stability as the
creators started to develop the IDE with the IDE itself at the time enough usability was given. Therefore bugs
were mostly found by the authors and could be fixed very quickly as well as needed extensions for programming
KDE applications.

The first official stable release was made with version 1.0 on December 6, 1999. Thereafter, the KDevelop Team
introduced more features and stability into the IDE by new code or code that was unstable before, which lead
to the second release as version 1.1 on February 28, 2000.

Since then, the project continud to integrate more functionality and simplifying the current codebase along
with many translators who transfer KDevelop to as most languages as possible to provide the international
developer community the IDE in their own language, including the handbooks that ship with it. Many users
contributed their experience and knowledge to the project as one of the most promising products for Linux/Unix
developers to make it even more stable and portable to other Unices.

After the 1.2 release on May 4th, we continued fixing several bugs while working on a 2.0 version using the KDE 2.0
API and the latest technologies KDE 2.0 offers. Since the release of Qt-2.2.0 brought Qt큦 Designer for constructing
user interfaces which also supports KDE widgets, the Designer is about to replace KDevelop큦 own dialog editor as it offers
dynamic layout management and directly connecting widgets. To support using the Designer within KDevelop, the templates and KDevelop
have been updated to make easy use of it while working on a KDE 2.0 or Qt 2.2.x project.

The 1.3 release marked another milestone. It was the last version that needed KDE 1.x libraries to run and was much anticipated through the offers it made towards
development for the new KDE 2.0 platform when it was released on December 11th, 2000.

Since then John Birch and I decided that we really would like to have a KDE 2.x version of our "baby", KDevelop. We took the time and made it- by the end of 2000,
we roughly had the functionality to say we were almost ready. While KDE 2.1 was short to come out early 2001, we decided to ship KDevelop with the base KDE distribution
as this version will make many new KDE developers happy to start working on a great API on a free system to develop software for.

<sect>Printed Versions
<p>
A printed version of the complete KDevelop Documentation is available as the book titled <bf>Developing
Applications for Linux: KDE Edition</bf>, which can be ordered either online from the KDevelop website at
<htmlurl url="http://www.kdevelop.org" name="http://www.kdevelop.org"> or at <htmlurl
url="http://www.opendocs.org" name="http://www.opendocs.org">. A share of the Gross Profits from the sales of
this book goes back to the KDevelop project to support continuing the further development of KDevelop.

Printable versions of the KDevelop Documentation can also be obtained from the KDevelop website at <htmlurl
url="http://www.kdevelop.org" name="http://www.kdevelop.org"> in DVI, PostScript and PDF format both in A4 and
Letter size.


<chapt><idx/Installation/<label id="Installation">
<p>
<sect>How to obtain KDevelop
<p>
KDevelop can be found either on the <idx/KDE/ Applications page at <url url="http://www.kde.org/current.html"> or on the KDevelop
homepage at <url url="http://www.kdevelop.org">. KDevelop is also available on Linux distributions, such
as SuSE 6.x. and 7.x

We're also offering snapshots of the KDevelop CVS repository on our homepage for those who want to stay up to date with
KDevelop. Usually, the snapshots are not intended to be used for production but as a test for new features and to give an insight
into development progress of the KDevelop team. Also we offer various third party software needed by KDevelop directly such as
<idx/KDoc/ and <idx/KDbg/.

If you're experiencing problems with compiling or using KDevelop, please read the <ref id="Questions and Answers" name="Questions and
Answers"> section of this handbook or the FAQ-file included with the KDevelop package. If your problem is not addressed, please
subscribe to the KDevelop mailing list at <htmlurl url="mailto:kdevelop-request@barney.cs.uni-potsdam.de" name =
"kdevelop-request@barney.cs.uni-potsdam.de"> by sending a mail with an empty header and "subscribe youremailaddress" as contents. Requests and
problem report should only target the usage of the KDevelop IDE and not towards any questions that regard any <idx/implementation/ problem you
may have while coding your own application. Anyway, all mails send to the mailing list should be written in English, so that all participants can
take part on discussions and are able to provide better help. The mailing list is also intended for those users willing to contribute and who found
solutions for any problems they experienced, so we can fix <idx/errors/ and include that knowledge to give beginners an even more qualified
first-hand help.

An good way to report problems is to send the <idx/output/ you get by starting kdevelop from the console or to copy and paste the
contents of KDevelop's internal <idx/Messages-window/.

<sect><idx/Requirements/
<p>
In order to successfully compile and use KDevelop, you need the following programs and libraries which are available on most platforms
as distribution packages and thereby can be installed easily.
<p>
<bf>Required:</bf>
<itemize>

</itemize>

KDevelop was tested with SuSE Linux as well as on several other platforms.

As far as known to the authors, SuSE Linux and FreeBSD contain all necessary packages, including <idx/enscript/ as packages or
rpm's, so you should have no problem installing the required third-party software.

<bf>Documentation:</bf>

For creating the <idx/KDE/ library documentation, you need the kdelibs package in source available on your
system as provided by the KDE project or included with the source packages of your distribution and <bf><idx/KDoc/</bf> (included in the
<idx/KDE-SDK/).

Also we're offering a C/C++ <idx/Reference/ on our homepage at <url url="http://www.kdevelop.org">
that is integrated into the <idx/documentation browser/ after it's installation. Download the package and copy the source file as
<tt/root/ into your <idx/KDE/ directory and untar it with <tt/tar zxvf c_c++_reference.tar.gz/, then the reference is available in the
documentation tree; otherwise selecting the reference book in the browser shows an error page with the KDevelop homepage URL offering a
download and describes the installation process. <sect>Compilation and Installation
<p>
In order to compile and install KDevelop on your system, type the following in the base directory of the KDevelop distribution:

<tscreen><verb>
	&percnt ./configure
	&percnt make

	(as root)

	&percnt make install
</verb></tscreen>


<p>Since KDevelop uses <tt><idx/autoconf/</tt> you should have not trouble compiling it.

In order to compile the KDevelop CVS snapshot, type the following :
<tscreen><verb>
	&percnt make -f Makefile.cvs
	&percnt ./configure
	&percnt make

	change as `root` and type:

	&percnt make install
</verb></tscreen>

If your system's <idx/make-command/ is <tt/gmake/, type <tt/gmake/ instead of <tt/make/.

<sect>Starting KDevelop
<p>
If you use <idx/KDE/ as your window manager, KDevelop can be started by choosing
"K"&rarr"Development"&rarr"KDevelop 1.4". As KDevelop supports <idx/KDE/-Mime-types, you can
also start by selecting a KDevelop project file ("*.kdevprj", displayed with the KDevelop project icon) in the
<idx/KDE/ File Manager which will start KDevelop and load the project.
Under other window managers, open a console and type:
<tscreen><verb>
&percnt kdevelop
</verb></tscreen>

To start KDevelop with an existing project, change into the project-directory and type:

<tscreen><verb>
&percnt kdevelop  &lt;yourProject&gt;.kdevprj
</verb></tscreen>

Under each user account KDevelop will invoke the <ref id="The Installation Program" name="automatic installation"> process on the
first start, allowing a quick configuration of the most needed options. If your installation is messed up, you can reconfigure KDevelop
any time either by entering

<tscreen><verb>
&percnt kdevelop  --setup
</verb></tscreen>

or, when using KDE, by choosing "K"&rarr"Development"&rarr"KDevelop Setup".

<sect>The Installation Program<label id="The Installation Program">
<p>
KDevelop includes an automatic installation program module which is invoked whenever KDevelop is started and
the configuration file kdeveloprc does not exist. We suggest you follow the installation steps by choosing
"Proceed" to automatically check your system and to set up your KDevelop environment.


The Installation dialog's buttons execute the following actions:
<p>
<bf>Help:</bf>  Will open  the KDEHelp program.
<p>
<bf>Proceed:</bf> This starts the installation process and executes the following actions:

<enum>
<item> Checking for make/gmake, <idx/autoconf/, autoheader, <idx/automake/ and perl for the creation and compilation of new applications
generated by KDevelop. If gmake is installed, the <idx/make-command/ will be set automatically to use gmake.  Other commandline options
to your make program can be set in the <idx/setup/ dialog accessed by the options menu later, an introduction into development under Unix is
explained in section <ref id="Programs" name="Programs">.

<item> Checking for <idx/KDoc/ and <idx/glimpse/.  Those will allow to create a new <idx/KDE-Library/ documentation and a <idx/search index/
automatically in a later <idx/setup/ step if found.

<item> Checking for <idx/enscript/ to ensure that <idx/printing/ is available.  This program has to be installed to
allow correct <idx/printing/. If it isn't installed, you can do this at any time later on at your option without having to run the
<idx/setup/ again.

<item> Checking for <idx/KDbg/, <idx/KIconEdit/ and <idx/KTranslator/.  We encourage you to install those programs as they are good
helpers for creating complete <idx/KDE/-applications. Note that <idx/KDbg/ is used directly for <idx/debugging/ your current project within
KDevelop; <idx/KIconEdit/ is used to display and edit <idx/pixmaps/ selected in the file-viewer trees. The programs <idx/KDbg/, <idx/KIconEdit/ and
<idx/KTranslator/ are then configured to be available in the "<idx/Tools/" menu of the KDevelop menu bar if they are found. Other tools
can be added to the <idx/Tools/-menu by selecting "<idx/Tools/..." in the Options menu later.

<item> Summary of detected programs: the installer lists those programs it found and those it didn't. Additional hints are given, if a
needed program is recommended.

<item>Detection of your <idx/Qt-Documentation/ path: this checks for several standard paths in your system for the documentation and
sets the path automatically. If your <idx/Qt-Documentation/ could not be found either because it is not installed or your system keeps it at
a different location, a message will appear that asks you to set the correct path manually or to continue. Choosing the button to set
the path will return to the main installation window and shows an editing field with a button on the right of it to choose the path.
Usually this is in the qt/html directory. After doing so, the installation can continue with the selection of "Proceed" again.

<item> If <idx/KDoc/ was detected, you are asked to create/update your <idx/KDE/-library documentation.  For that, you need to have the
kde-libraries in source form. For Linux-Users who have installed <idx/KDE/ from a distribution, we suggest to copying and extracting
the source of the kdelibs-package to your system; Free BSD users who installed the kdelibs as a package should look for their according
distfile package of the ports-collection.   If none of these cases match your situation, you should download the sources from <url
url="http://www.kde.org"> and untar the sources on your system. If you wish to use the documentation package provided by <url
url="http://developer.kde.org">, cancel the creation and continue with creating the <idx/search index/. After the installer finished
and KDevelop has been started, set the path to the extracted documentation package in the KDevelop Setup dialog and run the <idx/search
index/ <idx/setup/ again, which can be found at the same <idx/setup/ page of the dialog.

The "Update <idx/KDE/-Library documentation" dialog is set up to use a default path for the location of the documentation in
$(HOME)/.kde/share/apps/kdevelop/KDE-Documentation.  The only thing you have to do is choosing the path to your library sources you
extracted on the system with the selection button on top of the dialog and press OK. As an example, if you got the kdelibs.tar.gz
package from <url url="http://www.kde.org"> and downloaded it to your home directory, you should open a console or terminal and enter
"tar zxvf kdelibs.tar.gz". This will untar the sources into a directory $HOME/kdelibs, which then contains the sources for each library
in a subdirectory, e.g. for kdecore, this would be in /home/rnolden/kdelibs/kdecore. Now, the path you have to enter in the KDE-Library
documentation dialog would be the path to all libraries, in the example /home/rnolden/kdelibs. After pressing the OK button, a message
in the installation window shows that the documentation generation is in progress and you should wait for the next message.
<p>

<bf>NOTE:</bf> On a <idx/multi-user system/ or systems with <idx/disk-quotas/ for user accounts, the installation of a complete
<idx/HTML/ documentation for each user would be a waste of disk space. In this case, ask your system administrator to run KDevelop
under the root account to allow write access to the system's root directory. Then install the documentation within the
<idx/KDE/-directory, under $KDEDIR/share/apps/kdevelop/KDE-Documentation. The correct path can then be set up later in the KDevelop
<idx/setup/ dialog, available in the <idx/"Options"-menu/.

<item> If the system check found the <idx/glimpse/ program on your system, you are offered to create a search database. The
search database can be created with the options of including the <idx/KDE-Documentation/ and the <idx/Qt-Documentation/ (default). Additionally
the KDevelop documentation is included and will be indexed.  If you have other documentation that you want indexed you
can select the directories and add them to the indexing process as well.

<item> During the creation of the <idx/search index/, the installation window will show a message that this is in progress.

<item> If all installation steps were done correctly,  a final message states that KDevelop will be started
after pressing OK. Mind that you can set up additional options like auto saving in the
<ref id="General Configuration" name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog that can be accessed through the options menu.
</enum>

<bf>Cancel:</bf>  Will show a warning message that the installation process is going to be canceled.  This warning message allows you
to return to the installation ("Back") or to start KDevelop with the default values ("Continue"). Mind that in this case you will have
to set all options yourself with the <idx/configuration dialog/s provided in the options-menu.


<chapt>Programs<label id="Programs">
<p>
Now that KDevelop installed successfully and the most commonly used options are set, you are probably wondering if it keeps what
it promises. This Chapter gives you a guideline to how programs are created using the GNU tools in general and especially what
part KDevelop plays in this game.
<sect>The Compiler<label id="The Compiler">
<p>
The <idx/Compiler/ is actually the program on your system that has to be installed as a minimum to create running programs; he is the
one that compiles the source code into object files and creates the program.

Normally, you would start like this:
Open an editor of your choice - don't use a word-processor. Type in something like this to create the source for your first
program:

<tscreen><verb>
#include <iostream.h>

int main(){

cout << "Hello World" << endl;

}
</verb></tscreen>
Well, actually all the program will do is to print out the string "Hello World" to your standard <idx/output/. But this is just the
source code for the program to be build, not the program itself. Therefore, we need a <idx/Compiler/, in this case a C++-<idx/Compiler/ like
g++. Then we can save the file with the source code, as, let's say, myprogram.cpp and invoke the <idx/Compiler/ with the filename
(on a console):

<tscreen><verb>
g++ -o myprogram myprogram.cpp
</verb></tscreen>
Then we can start our program- just type <tt/myprogram/  on the console, and the program prints out the string; then exits.

<sect>Make and <idx/Makefile/s<label id="Make">
<p>
I have everything I need: an editor, a <idx/Compiler/ and I can execute my own C++ program. But it isn't all that easy. What happens if
you have more than one source file ? And, do you have to compile all sources over and over again only if you changed one file ?
Compiling will become more and more complicated and time-consuming, because you have to type in all the commands and options
yourself. Therefore, you could write a so-called "<idx/Makefile/". You could also call it some other name except the name of the program
to build. Then, you should have the tool <tt/make/ or <tt/gmake/ installed, or any other tool that is capable of keeping track of
a project's compilation. Insert all your <idx/Compiler/ commands in a certain syntax into that <idx/Makefile/ and save it; then you will only
have to type <tt/make/ or <tt/gmake/ on the console in the directory where your <idx/Makefile/ is located, and then make takes over,
leading the <idx/Compiler/ to create your application. The make utility has many other advantages and can be used to a lot of purposes.
To get a complete overview, open a console and type:

<tt/man make/

or search for "GNU Make" in KDEHelp, "System GNU Info contents".
At least, you have an insight, why a developer needs the make utility for making it easier to compile his application.
Now, writing <idx/Makefile/s is not only handwork until now, you also have to dig yourself into the whole syntax and options. But here
is the good news about KDevelop and any Make-utility: You just have to set the Make-Command in the <ref id="General Configuration"
name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog, and then you're done. All projects generated with KDevelop will use that Make command to build the
target application, and no typing at all. Just hit the buttons on the toolbar of KDevelop, beginning with the one after the second
separator line, or choose the desired function for Make in the "Build" menu.

The toolbar and the build-menu then offer the most-common functions that you need to let make do the dirty work:

<itemize>
<item> <idx/Compile File/: is only active if you're working on a source file. It invokes make with the correct command to compile only
the current source.
<item> Make: just calls make and creates your target.
<item> Rebuild all: rebuilds the whole project
<item> Clean/Rebuild all: cleans the project directory first and then runs make again.
<item> Stop Build: cancels the current process- this is mostly used if you watch make working and staring at your sources. Then-
ahh- I forgot about this line...and you have to correct your code. Just hit Stop, correct the error you found by yourself and run
Make again.
</itemize>

But this is not the only way how KDevelop works together with make- for <idx/KDE/ applications, there are some things that are special,
like creating the message files for internationalization. These functions are also included, so no worry about these things
anymore.

Until now, you know about sources, the <idx/Compiler/ and why make is needed. In the next section, we'll discuss how it comes that
projects created with KDevelop automatically can be compiled on most other Unix-platforms using the <tt/configure-/ script.

<sect>Configure<label id="Configure">
<p>
The title of this section lets you probably question: Configure ? What has to be configured ? Or who ?
Well, assume you have written a program including a <idx/Makefile/. Then you like to distribute it, but the binary compiled does only
run on your system or on systems that are compatible with yours. To support other platforms like different Unix-systems or
machines like Alpha's or RISC's, you have to recompile the program. The easiest way would be to copy the source package to the
target machine and run <tt/make/ again. But what if the target machine uses another <idx/Compiler/ command or has in some other way a
problem to build your binary ? Not to mention more difficult issues like installation paths for your program and documentation-
e.g. <idx/KDE/ can be installed in <tt//opt/kde/ on one machine, while it is installed under <tt//usr/local/kde/ on another. In this
case, you would have to rewrite the <idx/Makefile/ each time to ensure a correct compilation and installation of your product.

Fortunately, GNU-tools have even more to provide than that mighty <tt/make/- the commonly used <idx/automake/ and <idx/autoconf/
packages. It sounds good to hear something with "auto"- seems like something about application design can be done quick and easy,
which exactly hits the point.

Automake's purpose is generally to create a so-called <tt/<idx/Makefile.in// from a file <tt/<idx/Makefile.am// which you have to write for
your project. This <idx/Makefile.am/ consists of macros which can be interpreted and reduce the complexity that make offers, so a
<idx/Makefile.am/ is written safer and quicker than the final <idx/Makefile/.

Having this said, who is finally creating me my <idx/Makefile/ ? Now, here comes <idx/autoconf/. Autoconf requires several macro files
for the project. That are those <idx/Makefile.in/'s generated by <idx/automake/ and a file called <tt/configure.in/, also containing macros.
Hereby the <idx/Makefile.am/ and .in's are containing macros that are responsible for the way how to build the software in terms of
which sources have to be compiled, which files belong to the package and what name the final binary or library will have after a
build. Configure.in on the other hand contains macros for what the final configure-shell script will check for on the system
configure is executed. Those could be e.g. the <idx/Compiler/ command, required libraries against which the final binary will be linked,
include-files the project needs and their location.

For example you want to write a <idx/KDE/ application. After writing your sources,
you want to distribute the program to the user community, and each user has to compile the binary on his own. Then you would write
a configure.in file that contains the macros for a <idx/KDE/-compliant application. That one macro finally expands to a check on the
system whether the Qt-library is installed, checks for the Qt-header files, the <idx/KDE-libraries/ and headers etc.

<bf>Summary:</bf>  To create a GNU-compliant application that is portable to different Unix-OS's and machines other than yours,
you will need to do the following:

<enum>
<item> write the sources of your project
<item> write a <idx/Makefile.am/ for each subdirectory, including the main project directory of your project
<item> write a configure.in file placed in the main project directory containing the macros for system requirements
<item> run <idx/automake/
<item> run <idx/autoconf/
</enum>

Then the main work is done. Automake creates the <idx/Makefile.in/'s, <idx/autoconf/ processes the configure.in and
generates an executable shell script called <tt/configure/. All you then have to do is to execute it with  <tt/./configure/ and
the script will run the checks of your choice. Finally <idx/Makefile/s will be generated that allow a final execution of make (or gmake)
that will process all <idx/Makefile/s and then you're done.

This seems to be a lot of stuff for writing a small application and much to learn especially how to write correct macros. But even
the fact that you provide a compilation on almost all Unix-systems will be worth this work sooner or later. Finally, you only have
to do this work once for your project and in case your project's files increase you only have to add the filenames to the macros.


Now, how far does KDevelop support this kind of application development and how complicated does it get for the programmer ?
The good news is, that you don't even have to know anything about macros and scripts. All details are hidden behind an easy to use
graphical interface doing the work for you. An application is therefore created with GNU tools in a very user-friendly way:

Just generate your application with <idx/KAppWizard/, by the choice of your application's needs- may it be a pure C++ terminal
application or a kind of <idx/GUI/ program using Qt or the Qt/<idx/KDE/ libraries. All work is done automatically and your project
already contains the <idx/Makefile/s that are created by an auto-execution of the GNU-tools and the configure-script.

This is it- you're ready to extend the source of your project, may it be by adding <idx/classes/, dialogs, translations or
documentation, which is also completely automated. Just concentrate on the real work of the developer, which is providing
functionality for the final application that you want to create. In most cases, you probably won't come in touch with <idx/Makefile/s at
all when using KDevelop.

<sect>Debugging<label id="Debugging">
<p>
The following section covers a term that is widely used by developers: Debugging.  It means, that, although your <idx/Compiler/ produces
the final application, your application may not run or crash during execution due to a so-called "bug" in the code. A program
error described by the name of this insect comes from the history of computing; one of the first <idx/errors/ that caused a machine to
crash was not obviously a malfunction- bugs were inside the computer which were responsible for it. Therefore, an error not
detectable on the first look is called a "bug", so "<idx/debugging/" means to throw out bugs where they shouldn't be. Now, you don't
have to hunt them for real; assuming that today's computers are designed to keep them out by some kind of outer protection.
They have to be found inside the code, mostly ending the execution of a program with the message "Segmentation fault". GNU
provides another tool called <tt/gdb/, the GNU debugger. This terminal program allows to watch the internal values of an
application and the execution step by step with setting "breakpoints" in the code. Gdb stops the execution every time the program
comes to a breakpoint while executing. But like most other tools, the debugger is handled by another program providing a frontend
to it, allowing to easily watch values and the setting of breakpoints in the code.

For this purpose, your project's application is by default created with a <idx/Compiler/ option for <idx/debugging/, thereby storing
additional data in the executable to allow the localization of values and lines in the code. As a third-party frontend to gdb,
KDevelop makes use of <idx/KDbg/, the KDebugger. To debug your program, you just have to select "Debug" in the Build-menu or press the
according toolbar button displayed by a wheel having glasses over it, signaling that you want to watch the execution.

KDevelop then opens the <idx/Tools/-window and starts your application with <idx/KDbg/. The <idx/KDbg/ interface appears inside the <idx/Tools/-window and
allows the usage just like you started it from outside.

In general, the above steps are clearly showing the need of certain steps that a developer has to do when starting to write his
own application, and cover issues that are common to all projects. Also, we explained what part KDevelop does for a developer and
how it supports the idea of providing an easy way to Unix programming. To get further information about the role and purpose of
GNU tools, you should read the documentation provided with them, commonly accessed via the <tt/man/ command or by the "System GNU
Info contents" section in KDEHelp.

<chapt>Development with KDevelop<label id="Development with KDevelop">
<p>
In this chapter you will get a general overview how you can use KDevelop and the <idx/Qt Designer/ to create own applications.
Thereby, all tools are described by their use during the development process. If you are a beginner in C++/<idx/GUI/ design and
programming, you should read <htmlurl url="programming/index.html" name="The KDevelop Programming Handbook">, which describes some
basics for program design and shows a more detailed use of KDevelop by sample projects which you can follow step-by-step to get used
with the way applications are created using KDevelop. Also you should have read chapter <ref id="Programs" name="Programs"> to gain a
general understanding why Unix applications should make use of provided development tools; this will make things easier when you hit
references to what <idx/Makefile/s are etc.

<sect>What are KDevelop Project Applications ?
<p>
Projects created with KDevelop make it very easy for developers to use the GNU standard development tools. In opposition to the
self-creation of <idx/Makefile/s, which have to be written anyway because of the project's complexity, those provide not only a better
way of <idx/Makefile/ generation but also a good and safe way to provide a fast adaption towards different systems by <idx/autoconf/-generated
<tt/configure/ scripts.

The distribution of your applications does not require the end-user to have anything different installed than a C++ <idx/Compiler/ and
the development libraries, which is most often the case; but you can as well distribute binary packages of your application. In
either way, the end-user of your product does not have to have KDevelop installed. For giving away your sources, we advise to
include the project file of KDevelop as well, as this makes it very easy for other developers to work with your sources if they
use KDevelop as well. For projects where several developers, maybe working on different places, are involved, this should the case
anyway to ensure consistency of the <idx/Makefile/s so you don't run into trouble. Especially on multi language applications, translators
won't actually work with the source code, except in cases that require corrections for enabling translation support. Anyway, those
will be thankful as KDevelop simplifies their work to a minimum by adding their language and reducing the work to concentrate on
the translation.

With using KDevelop for your own projects, you would start creating a new application with the <idx/KAppWizard/. There, you can also
set the project type according the goals of your program. Then, you would start developing the user interface by adding
<idx/widgets/ that are already constructed in the libraries and only have to be called by your application, or by self-constructions
that can be made with the Qt Designer. Next comes the extension of the user interface by changing and extending those parts that
are already made by KDevelop like the statusbar, menubar and toolbars. As resources are collected in a resource file, this can be
extended simply by adding new values to the already existing one; the given resources can also be used as a guideline for adding
your specific ones. After implementing the functionality to methods that are either generated empty by the <idx/Qt Designer/ or already
containing code for standard user actions, you should extend the User Manual by simply editing the provided <idx/SGML/ index file
towards describing your applications capabilities. The last step would be to generate translation files and to distribute your
project to translators doing the rest to enhance internationalization.

But even for non-<idx/GUI/ application Designers the IDE offers an easy way to create new projects; the editor and Class Browser in
conjunction with KDevelop's powerful project management will reduce the time for development to the minimum that is required for
<idx/implementation/ of functionality.

<sect>Short Description of KDevelop's <idx/Tools/
<p>
With KDevelop you have chosen a package, that, in conjuction with the use of other tools, will provide you a prefect and flexible
environment for object-orientated application development under Unix-Systems. Generally, KDevelop consists of the programming
environment and integrates the <idx/Designer/ coming with Qt 2.2.x ; besides that all needed programs that can be helpful for designing applications are embedded in
one or the other way.

<sect1>Programming Environment and the Qt Designer
<p>

<sect2>The Programming Environment
<p>
The Programming Environment is the user interface that KDevelop provides for creating and maintaining projects, implicitly using
many other tools by simplifying their use. It's built-in Editor and <idx/Helpbrowser/ as well as the Class Browser reduce the amount of
work that development processes usually burden on the programmer. The ease of use make writing applications for Unix an enjoyment
on it's own and will probably result in shorter release cycles and better development improvements. From here, you're managing
your project throughout all its details, keep the overview over your <idx/classes/ and don't have to use additional consoles for your
work, as well as the integration of all user interfaces results in the fact that you only have to work with one window under X and
don't have to watch for several ones spread all over your desktop.

<sect2>Qt's Designer
<p>
In its current release, KDevelop makes use of the Qt Designer for all KDE 2.0/Qt 2.x project templates.
Mind that the Designer has to be included in your PATH variable to be automatically called from within
KDevelop. The configure scripts of KDE 2.0/Qt 2.x templates will search for the uic as well to generate
C++ output from your .ui files created with Designer. KDevelop takes care of automatically adding .ui files
to Makefile.am under the _SOURCES line while dependencies are automatically resolved by the am_edit script.

However, KDevelop comes with a converter script (kdlgdesinger) that helps you port existing
*.kdevdlg files created with KDevelop큦 internal dialogeditor to *.ui files that can be processed
with the Qt desinger. you can find it in the "tools" subdirectory of your kdevelop installation.

Note that can add native support for KDE in Qt Designer by reconfiguring Qt with the "-kde" switch
once KDE has been installed. After recompiling Qt's tools directory, you will get a Designer
that has native support for most of the KDE widgets and integrates seamlessly into KDE in concerns
of look and feel.


<sect1><idx/KAppWizard/ and the Classtools
<p>
The <idx/KAppWizard/ and the Classtools provided for project generation and automatic code extension are intended to make the
creation of applications as easy and safe as possible and offers a good way for beginners in Qt/<idx/KDE/ programming to start
actually working themselves into the details of <idx/GUI/ application design, as results can be achieved very quickly.

<sect2><idx/KAppWizard/
<p>
<idx/KAppWizard/ is intended to create full-functional application projects that are ready-to-run by using GNU-standard tools and, for
<idx/GUI/-programs, taking advantage of the <idx/KDE/ and Qt libraries. By specifying only the information that is required as a
minimum, users are enabled to start working at a new project within seconds. Calling <idx/KAppWizard/ should be the first step to be done for
creating a new application with KDevelop.

<idx/KAppWizard/ provides you a so-called application skeleton with all needed C++ source code files for a running application. After
you specified a projectname and set the needed preferences, your new project will be generated and you have a complete application
that already contains a lot of functionality (for KDE and Qt projects), without even having to type one line of C++ code yourself. When
specifying the complete set of options the program generator offers, your application already contains:
<itemize>
<item>an SDI-Interface (for working with one document per application window), based on the document-view-controller model
<item>Menus and dialogs for opening and saving files as well as <idx/printing/ dialogs
<item>a toolbar and statusbar already providing complete functionality
<item>a helpsystem, containing an <idx/SGML/-based user manual and statusbar help
<item>a complete <idx/HTML/-based <idx/API/ (application programming interface) documentation for the current state of the project
<item>an installation routine though make
</itemize>

The <idx/KAppWizard/ is available by the Project-menu, entry "New...".

<sect2>Classtools
<p>
The term "Classtools" describes a variety of functions that are available for the developer to work on a project not only by
an object-orientated language but using the sources in an object-orientated way. Working with <idx/classes/ instead of having to
watch for files offers a very flexible way to extend a project and lets the user concentrate on the objects the project contains.
The tools that KDevelop offers are a Classgenerator and a Class Browser, where each one provides a lot of automated
functionality.

<sect3> Creating a new class with the Classgenerator
<p>
After generating a project with the <idx/KAppWizard/ your work as a developer would be to add a set of <idx/classes/ that match the design of
the application. The typical process without using KDevelop would be to create a new header and sourcefile, add them manually to
the according <idx/Makefile.am/ and to start writing the <idx/classes/ <idx/declaration/ and <idx/implementation/. To simplify the whole process, the
Classgenerator lets you do this by only specifying the new class by its name, inherited class, inheritance attribute and further
information such as class documentation by it's purpose for the project. Additionally, you can also change the filenames that are
preset by the generator and if the class would be Qt-signal/slot enabled by default.

The rest of the work is done automatically- you don't have to take care for <idx/Makefile.am/, files and the class itself. A new "make"
invocation is enough to include the new class in the compilation process. As the Class Browser updates itself after the addition of
a class, the <idx/declaration/ and <idx/implementation/ is available at once and you can start working on the extension of the class. The
Classgenerator is invoked by the Project-menu, entry "<idx/New Class/".

<sect3>The Class Browser
<p>
The Class Browser displays all types of objects and functions of your project in a tree left of the editing windows. A class parser
scans all files for methods and <idx/classes/ and makes them available by graphical symbols. Over those, context-menus offer a
specialized functionality to work with the sources by focusing on the <idx/classes/ and functions.

Selecting a class will result in opening the file that contains the <idx/declaration/; on methods and functions this will
show you the <idx/implementation/. For a full description, see <ref id="The Class Browser" name="The Class Browser">

<sect> The Development Process
<p>
The development of a new application with KDevelop can generally be divided into two major steps: first, you have to generate a
program skeleton with <idx/KAppWizard/, then the "rest" of the development has to be done using KDevelop's features, which only
requires your abilities as a programmer. To describe the development process, we assume you want to create a Qt/<idx/KDE/ application,
which implies using most of KDevelop's features for working with these types of project, so you have a general "HOW-TO".

<sect1>Creating a Program Skeleton
<p>
To start creating your application, you normally would call the <idx/KAppWizard/, enter the project name and generate the program. By
this, the wizard automatically creates a project file for the application and inserts the KDevelop areas into the <idx/Makefile.am/'s
which will be used later when extending the application. The project file is the file you have to load for opening the project in
later sessions.

You call <idx/KAppWizard/ by the "Project"-menu, entry "New...". When the wizard appears, you have to specify the project
type on the first page. Selecting "Next >>" brings you to the next page where you have to insert the project name, version,
directory and your personal information. Page 3 offers more detailed options, page 4 and 5 allow editing file headers for header
and <idx/implementation/ files that are inserted automatically according to your selection. If you already have file headers you want to
use, you can choose those files as well. The last page contains an <idx/output/ window and an error message window. When selecting
"Create", your application will be generated and the actions that are executed can be seen in the <idx/output/ window. If READY appears
in the <idx/output/ window, the <idx/KAppWizard/ is finished and you can select "Exit" to return to the Programming Environment. To build the
binary, choose "Make" from the Build-menu or choose the according button in the toolbar. You can as well test the functions already
present by choosing "Execute" from the Build-menu.

<sect1>Developing an Application
<p>
This section describes the development phase of applications with KDevelop and the <idx/Qt Designer/- and all work can be done within
the IDE.

The development steps are generally to edit the source files, the compilation of the project sources followed by the <idx/Linker/
process binding all object files to the final binary. Then <idx/errors/ have to be located which either prevented a compilation or
linking or are semantical bugs that can be found by a <idx/debugging/ session. Finally, the documentation has to be extended and
translations have to be added. But as all those steps can mix which each other, it is not that easy to describe a general way how
to develop your own application. Typically, the usual procedure would be to first create all visible parts of the project like the
main view and the dialogs for configuring any options, then generate the source code and implement all needed connections that
still have to be done like changing the menubar and toolbars, adding statusbar help for new menu entries and fill the new member
functions with objects that are displaying your dialogs. Then you would compile your application and test it's capabilities, fix
<idx/errors/ and test it again. The following sections describe how this would be done; for your particular application
you may choose another way- KDevelop leaves you enough flexibility to decide what to do at what time.

<sect2>User Interfaces
<p>
The User Interface of an application is actually what the user sees and by which he interacts with the program. Therefore a
program generally has a menubar, toolbars and a statusbar as well as a main view which would be e.g. a text input window for an
editor. <idx/KAppWizard/ generated applications already contain a complex functionality on graphical interfaces- the frame structure
takes care of standard elements such as bars and buttons. When developing your application, you have to extend the given structure
to give the program the user interaction capability you want to provide. One part of the work is the design of dialogs e.g. for
changing values like the brush width in a paint application. This can be done easily with the <idx/Qt Designer/. Now,
how do you create those good-looking dialogs ? As the <idx/Qt-library/ is a <idx/GUI/ toolkit, it provides a base set of so-called "<idx/widgets/"
like labels displaying plain text, lineedits for text input and buttons for navigation and selection commands. Besides these
"low-level" parts of user interfaces, standard dialogs are provided and are ready to use such as <idx/printing/ dialogs. The
<idx/KDE-libraries/ then are based on the Qt-library and contain replacements for certain dialogs as well as additional <idx/widgets/ that
can be used in your application. So, when you start designing your applications behavior towards the user, you should make yourself
comfortable with the <idx/widgets/ provided with Qt and <idx/KDE/. The online-documentation of Qt offers screenshots for most of them,
so you should have a look there first. Then we advise to have a closer look at the KDE-UI library, offering other <idx/widgets/. Libraries
like the K<idx/HTML/ library contains very specialized <idx/widgets/ that a lot of programs make use of. It just simplifies application design like
the predefined dialogs provided with Qt. For your own dialogs, those low-level <idx/widgets/ are the one you need. A dialog merely
consists by a collection of different <idx/widgets/ combined together building the interface and is technically programmed by C++ code
in a class that is derived from <tt/<cdx/QWidget// or a more specialized dialog class that inherits <tt/<cdx/QWidget//. The program
using the widget therefore needs an object of the widget's class- this is almost all you have to understand how dialogs or views are
used.
The <idx/Qt Designer/ coming with Qt can be used to easily create dialogs and user interfaces. You can use the "Switch to Qt Designer"
button from KDevelop's menubar. This will bring up the Designer where you can create a new dialog. You can also choose an existing
.ui file from the fileview and KDevelop will bring up the Designer with your dialog. You can add dialogs easily by adding a new .ui file from
the File menu.
The Designer creates .ui files which contain an xml description of the class. Once you added the file to your project, KDevelop will take
care that it is included in your Makefile. The build system will automatically create the header- and implementation files for you.
Now all you have to do to either create a new class that inherits the dialog class and implement functionality or use the dialog directly.
Thus, using the Designer to create dialogs has a clear advantage: Code and layout are scrictly seperated, allowing you to change the
design of your dialog without rewriting one line of code. This way you can concentrate on what's really important: the actual coding process.
For futher information on the Designer's concepts read the Qt Designer handbook which can also be found in KDevelops docview.


<sect2>Binding New Elements
<p>
After you have created your user interfaces and generated the sources, you are ready to make your application use them by objects.
As described above, a usual <idx/GUI/-based program contains bars and the main view; additionally the main view operates with the bars,
which are part of the main application class, and the document object which it is connected to. In terms of object-oriented
design, you would describe the given architecture as the "Document-View-Controller"-model. This model describes the basic
functions for objects in an application towards their role within the program. The Controller represents the one coordinating the
main application and provides user interaction through a menubar and additionally toolbars and a statusbar. The Document class
takes the task of representing a document the user works with. Therefore, a document class should do all actions like loading
files and saving them again. The view now is in the center of the application window, showing the user a part of the document
visually and provides all functions to manipulate the data by the user. As the bars and toolbars are already present, your work
would be to create the main view and additional dialogs by which the user can change any settings or has access to additional
functions.

To build your main-view, the generated source code for your application already contains a class in the form of
&lt;YourApplication&gt;View which inherits the <tt/<cdx/QWidget// class (this is the minimal class that handles visual interfaces in Qt
and therefore in <idx/KDE/ as well). In general, there are three different ways how to extend the given class:
<itemize>
<item>remove the document-view structure and use one of the predefined "big" <idx/widgets/ already containing a lot of functionality-
just remove the View-class and replace the view-object by another.
<item>change the inheritance of the View-class. Change the inheritance to e.g. QMultiLineEdit and your application would be an
editor.
<item>if your main view will consist of several separated parts, create the <idx/widgets/ and their <idx/classes/ you need with the
<idx/Qt Designer/ and create objects of these <idx/classes/ in the view-class constructors that in combination will build the main view.
</itemize>

For dialogs, things are a bit different. The usual way would be to call a dialog through a menubar entry and additionally by a
toolbar icon. After you constructed your dialog and generated the sources, the class is available for creating an object that will
be the dialog. So you first have to look for a suitable place in the menubar to add an entry which will open the dialog when
selected by the user. If the already given menus do not match your needs, create a new popup menu just like the others and insert
your entry and the slot you want to call when the menuitem gets selected. Then implement the slot by creating an instance of the
dialog class and call the dialog with the <idx/member functions/ given by the base class. Also you have to specify an ID for the
menuentry. The frame applications have all IDs already given collected in a file resource.h, so you only have to add the ID and
give it a new number. Then you're done- additionally you could construct another toolbar icon and add the statushelp message. Your
application now offers a new functionality which is visible to the user. Now you have to add the <idx/implementation/ of methods that
your dialog will be operating with to manipulate any values. Finally, call your make-tool or "Execute" and the changed files will
be recompiled; the result of your changes can then be tested immediately.

<sect2>The Complete Development Process
<p>
Above, we discussed the usual way how to start working on a new application using KDevelop and how to extend the user interface.
Now, these are the standard steps where the IDE helps you, but KDevelop does more than providing tools for creating applications
and their visual parts. The following gives a short description of the main functionality that is offered for enhancing
application development.

<sect3>Sourcecode Management
<p>
The KDevelop IDE provides a lot of methods to the programmer to achieve his goals within the shortest time.  As described above,
the <idx/KAppWizard/ and the <idx/Qt Designer/ shorten the time you would usually need to get to the same result manually. But this
didn't cover the work a programmer has to do usually: working on the <idx/implementation/ of his application to provide a proper
execution by the end-user. Now, why is KDevelop the IDE you would want to use as a coding environment, including it's use to
create even non-<idx/GUI/ applications ?

Implicitly, the IDE keeps track of your project in general; that means, you don't have to take care for saving changes, the
<idx/Makefile/ generation and so on- this is providing full project-management, and KDevelop plays out all it's power here in any case
of C++ application development. It is easy to understand that, after taking away the management from the programmer, he is more
concentrated on working out the sourcecode. On the other hand, the code is usually spread over many different files across
the project, so you can separate certain parts. But this means still working the hard way- being the developer, you still
would have to struggle with creating these files and writing standard contents like file headers containing the date and the
author's name as well as e.g. license terms for the code. Additionally, this requires that you have to remember where your
functions, class <idx/declaration/s and <idx/implementation/s are in the project. Therefore, KDevelop contains the Classtools- a variety of
actions, that allow fast work and moving the developer's focus from files to objects- <idx/classes/, structures and methods. The
classgenerator lets you create a new class including inheritance, <idx/attributes/ and documentation easily . For object-oriented work,
the Class Browser brings you to the location of your objects; it doesn't matter any more where the code is actually. The
Browser scans all sources automatically and rebuilds itself after additions to keep up with your work and enables you to access
the new code directly. By context-menus, the browser offers even more functionality, like bringing you to the <idx/implementation/ or to
the <idx/declaration/ of <idx/member functions/. Then, the addition of members are done graphically by dialogs- no search for the file and the
place you would have to add your entries. Finally, you can get an even more specialized view of your project's <idx/classes/ by the
Classtool dialog, providing you trees that show the usage, contents and inheritance of <idx/classes/ and their objects. For more
detailed information, see <ref id="The Class Browser" name="The Class Browser">.

<sect3>Building and Executing your Application
<p>
The KDevelop IDE is specially designed to take away all those steps that you have to do periodically like building and executing
your program as well as locating <idx/errors/ in the sourcecode.

You're starting the build-process by:
<itemize>
<item>clicking on the symbols "Build" or "Rebuild All" in the toolbar
<item>or selecting "Build"/"Rebuild All" from the Build-menu.
</itemize>

To execute your application, choose
<itemize>
<item>the symbol "Execute" or "Debug" (starting <idx/KDbg/ with your program) from the toolbar
<item>by the according menu entries in the Build-menu.
<item>or by "Execute with Arguments" to start your application with additional arguments
</itemize>
For more information about the build-process, see <ref id="Projects" name="Projects">.

<sect3>Searching Program Errors
<p>
As naturally <idx/errors/ occur either during the build-process (which are detected by the <idx/Compiler/ and are called syntactical <idx/errors/
because they result from a wrong syntax of the sources) or during the execution of the application, those have to be found and
removed by the programmer. For locating <idx/errors/, the developer needs the information what exactly caused its occurance. As
mentioned, the <idx/Compiler/ is able to detect syntax <idx/errors/ himself, resulting in that the executable can't be build (this can also
happen by the <idx/Linker/ when he detects "unresolved symbols"-see <ref id="Linker Options" name="Linker Options">). As he gives out a
description of the error as detailed as possible, the error can be found and removed. During the build-process, you will see the <idx/output/
window pop up showing you what your make-tool and the <idx/Compiler/ has to say. In case of <idx/errors/ or <idx/warnings/, just press the mouse button
over the error line and the editor will open the affected file and sets the cursor to the errorline. This can also be done by the
entries in the "View"-menu, "Next Error" and "Previous Error" or by the according keyboard <idx/shortcuts/. You will find that this is very
functional and saves a lot of time to get to the error, thus for removing the cause your knowledge as a programmer is asked.

Runtime Errors, which occur during execution and will mostly result in a segmentation fault, are sometimes hard to find.
Therefore, you can enable the <idx/Compiler/ to add information within the binary to watch the execution by the sourcecode. A debugger
then is another program that lets you do this by starting the application and letting you set breakpoints in the code where the
execution stops, so you can control critical <idx/implementation/s and by this detect at least the line that caused the error. Finding
the real cause is another task; it depends on the programmer to locate this. The <bf/gdb/ is a debugger that is provided with the
GNU <idx/Compiler/ and programs like <em/ddd/ or <em/<idx/KDbg// are frontends that allow an easier use. KDevelop therefore uses <idx/KDbg/ and lets
you invoke the <idx/debugging/ process by the commands "Debug" in the Build-menu or by the "Debug" symbol in the toolbar. For more
information about <idx/debugging/ applications, see <ref id="Projects" name="Projects"> and <htmlurl url="programming/index-12.html"
name="The KDevelop Programming Handbook">.

<chapt>Overview<label id="Overview">
<p>
Looking at KDevelop, the user interface can be described by it's logical separation: the main window, the treeview and the <idx/output/
window, surrounded by the menubar, toolbars and the statusbar. This section describes the purpose of each part of the interface,
starting by the windows, followed by the bars and the functions they provide.

<sect>Main Window
<p>
The main window consists of four tabulators for which the left two are for editing purpose. First comes the Header-/Resource
window for headers and any other text files like the documentation <idx/SGML/'s, then the C/C++ window for sourcecodes. These are
followed by the Documentation window displaying in <idx/HTML/-format. At last is the <idx/Tools/ window for external programs like <idx/KIconEdit/
and <idx/KDbg/ which are embedded into the IDE. Any Tool that is registered can be accessed via the <idx/Tools/-menu; whereas the registration
of third-party programs can easily be done by a <idx/configuration dialog/ (see <ref id="General Configuration" name="General
Configuration">). For a description of the Editor windows functionality, see chapter <ref id="Working with the Editor" name="Working
with the Editor">, and for the <idx/Helpbrowser/, you should look at section <ref id="Using the Documentation Browser" name="Using the
Documentation Browser">.

<sect> The Class Browser and Fileviewers
<p>

<sect1>The <idx/Class Viewer/
<p>
The <idx/Class Viewer/ (<bf/Classes/) shows the <idx/classes/ of your project as well as global functions and <idx/variable/s.
Opening the tree will show all <idx/member functions/ and members with symbols for <idx/attributes/ (private, protected and public,
signals and slots), so you can see the properties of members visually without switching to the header file.  Selecting the class name
will open the according headerfile containing the class and set the cursor to the class <idx/declaration/ beginning. Selecting
<idx/member functions/ will open the <idx/implementation/ file and place the cursor at the function header.	For elements, KDevelop will
look for the header file and place the cursor at the line the element is declarated.	The <idx/classviewer/ also provides popup-menus
that offer more specified options, see <ref id="The Class Browser" name="The Class Browser"> for more detailed information.

Mind that the Class Viewer does <bf/not/ display generated files like those generated by moc and uic as they get removed from the distribution
as well as they are not present on a clean development tree.

<sect1>The Logical File Viewer
<p>
The Logical File Viewer (<bf/Groups/) allows sorting files by filters in groups. Individual groups can be added by the properties
entry of the project menu or by a right click on the tree items. This allows a more specialized search for files that you want to
access quickly, in the first place only showing project-included files. According to their Mime-type, the files will be opened
when selected. You will like the <idx/LFV/ for things like selecting <idx/pixmaps/- this will start <idx/KIconEdit/ (if installed on the system) in
the <idx/Tools/-window and opens the chosen picture.

<sect1>The Real File Viewer
<p>
The Real File Viewer (<bf/Files/) shows the project directory tree with all files, so you can edit non-<idx/project files/ or files
hidden by the <idx/LFV/ like configure.in and <idx/Makefile/s.
Popup-menus also provide functions like adding or removing files to the current project.

<sect1>The Documentation Tree
<p>
The Documentation Tree (<bf/Books/) displays all available <idx/HTML/-based documentation that is configured as books. Selecting a
book will open the first page in the Browser window. Also, a popup-menu provides personal configuration for additional <idx/HTML/-based
documentation packages.

<sect>Output window
<p>
The Output window is separated as well into a messages window, a stdin/stdout
window and a stderr window for the following necessities:
<itemize>
<item> messages window:	displays all <idx/output/ of the <idx/Compiler/. Clicking on error messages will change the edit widget to set the
cursor to the line the <idx/Compiler/ found an error.
<item> stdout window: display for terminal based applications that send messages to the standard <idx/output/ of the computer. Note that
Terminal applications are now started in an external console window.
<item> stderr window: displays all the error messages your program
produces. This is useful for testing purposes. The Output window is programmed to show up each time an external process is called,
such as make or a terminal application.
</itemize>

<sect><idx/Menubar/ Commands
<p>

<sect1>File Management and Printing
<p>
This section covers the functions that KDevelop provides about files; accessed via the File-menu in the menubar or by the
according icons in the toolbar:
<nidx/"File"-menu/

files, "Search in files..." should be used.<p>
<item><bf/Repeat Search	F3/ Repeats the last search for an expression. This also counts for searches that were made across the
documentation, where more than one hit was found in the same page. The next hit will be displayed by choosing "Repeat Search"
or F3 and signed as marked.<p>
<item><bf/Replace...		Ctrl+R/ Opens the "Search and Replace" dialog that allows the search for an expression and replaces the found
text with a new expression.<p>

<item><bf/Search in files...		Ctrl+Alt+F/Displays the "Search in files..." dialog, that handles <tt/<idx/grep// on whole directories with
wildcards. Search results are displayed with a list of the filenames, line and expression. Choosing an entry will open the file
and the cursor is set to the line of the <idx/search result/<p>
<item><bf/Select All  Ctrl+A/ Selects the whole text of the file currently opened in the top editing window<p>
<item><bf/Deselect All/ Deselects the whole text of the current file. This is often used for multiple selections so you don't have
to deselect each one separately<p>
<item><bf/Invert Selection/ Inverts the selection, meaning that a selection becomes deselected and text which is not selected
becomes selected.<p>
</itemize>
<p>

<sect1>View Configuration
<p><nidx/"View"-menu"/
The View-Menu covers closing and opening functions for windows and commands to enable/disable the tool- and statusbar as well as
to jump <idx/errors/ in the code.
<itemize>
<item><bf/Goto Line...	Ctrl+G/Opens a "Go to Line..." dialog that lets you insert a linenumber to show in the actual file. The last
linenumber is remembered and marked, so you can either jump to that line again or just enter a new linenumber you want to see.<p>
<item><bf/Next Error		F4/Jumps to the next error KDevelop detects from the <idx/output/. The <idx/output/ message of Make or other tools should
give you a descriptive help what the problem is, so you can correct the error.<p>
<item><bf/Previous Error		Shift+F4/ Jumps to the previous error that was reported.<p>
<item><bf/Tree-View	Ctrl+T/ en/disables the Tree window on the left side of the main view containing the Class Browser, <idx/LFV/,

</itemize>
<p>

<sect1>Creating and Maintaining Projects
<p><nidx/"Project"-menu/
This section describes functions that are available in the "Project"-menu and are supposed to cover the creation and maintaining
of projects
<itemize>
<item><bf/New.../ Starts the <idx/KAppWizard/ and allows you to create a new project by choosing application type, name,
version and other options.<p>
<item><bf/Open/ Shows the Open Project dialog, where you can choose a KDevelop project file to be opened. After selection, the
project will be loaded.<p>
<item><bf/Open recent project.../ contains a submenu with the last 5 opened projects. You can open a project more easily using the
recent project menu.<p>
<item><bf/Close/Closes the current project. This is mostly done automatically when you quit KDevelop, invoke the
<idx/KAppWizard/ or open another project.<p>
<item><bf/<idx/New Class/.../Starts the class generator to create a new class that will be added to the current project. The class
generator lets you specify classname, inheritance and filenames for the new class.<p>
<item><bf/Add existing File(s)/ Opens a selection dialog where you can choose the files that you want to add to the current project and
the path where they will be copied to. If you choose a destination that was currently not included in the project, e.g. creating a new
subdirectory, KDevelop will copy the files to add to the new subdirectory and create a new <idx/Makefile.am/. After the copy process,
your project will be rebuild by <idx/automake/ and <idx/autoconf/ to include the new subdirectory into the make-process.<p>
<item><bf/Add new translation file/ Opens a language selection dialog that lets you choose the translation file language that will be
added to the project. This is mostly used by translators who can easily add their language to the project and work on the
translation without having to care about the <idx/Makefile.am/'s<p>
<item><bf/File Properties Shift+F7/ Opens the File Properties dialog showing a copy of the <idx/LFV/ and the project file options. Here, the
properties for your files have to be set like installation path and file type.<p>
<item><bf/Make messages and merge/ This is intended to create the messages file for your project. The message file is the one
containing all strings that are set up in the sources for internationalization and is used by translators to create the .po file
for their target language.<p>
<item><bf/Make <idx/API/-Doc/ Calls <idx/KDoc/ on your header files and generates a <idx/HTML/ <idx/output/ with the documentation of your project
<idx/classes/.<p>
<item><bf/Make User-Manual/ runs <idx/KSgml2Html/ on your manual <idx/SGML/ file, creating a <idx/HTML/ user manual. If <idx/KSgml2Html/ is not installed,
sgml2html will be used to do this.<p>
<item><bf/Make Distribution:/<p>
<itemize>
<item><bf/tar.gz / creates a distribution file of your current project in the project directory that is ready to ship to the end-users
containing the sources of your project. The end-user has to <tt/tar zxvf yourproject.tar.gz / to unpack it to a source directory and
use the standard commands <tt>./configure, make </tt>and <tt/make install/.<p>
</itemize>
<item><bf/Load Tags File/ Generates and loads the file containing the tags needed for source code navigation.<p>
<item><bf/Options  F7/ Opens the Project Options dialog that
lets you change various settings for your project. This could be a new version number or the <idx/compiler options/ to set to -02 for a
release with optimization.<p>
</itemize>
<p>

<sect1>Building Projects
<p><nidx/"Build"-menu/
This section describes the Build menu that covers all actions to be done with make or actions like rebuilding the project's online
help or <idx/API/ documentation.

<itemize>
<item><bf/Compile file... Ctrl+F8/Active, if the top editing window is the C++ Window. This only compiles the current <idx/implementation/
file and lets you save time in case you suspect <idx/errors/.<p>
<item><bf/Make  F8/ Invokes the <idx/make-command/ to your project and builds the target.<p>
<item><bf/Rebuild All/ Rebuilds all object files and the target of you project.<p>
<item><bf/Clean Rebuild All/ Cleans the project directory from all make-created files and rebuilds the target.<p>
<item><bf/Stop Build  F10/ Stops the current process.<p>
<item><bf/Execute F9/ Executes your target after building the program with make.<p>
<item><bf/Execute with Arguments Alt+F9/ Executes your target with arguments. First, a dialog appears to let you specify the execution
arguments (which are saved in the project for the next session), then your application uses the entered commandline. Mind that your
application program is started from the project directory directly<p>
<item><bf/Debug.../ Opens <idx/KDbg/ in the <idx/Tools/-Window to debug your
application. In this case, <idx/KDbg/ automatically opens the file containing the main() function and executes your application.<p>
<item><bf/Distclean/ Removes all files that are generated by the project like object files etc. Distclean has to be done before
distributing your project, so the distribution file doesn't contain any platform-specific files like those that were generated by your
<idx/Compiler/.<p>
<item><bf/Autoconf and <idx/automake// Calls Make on the file <idx/Makefile.dist/, located in your main project directory. <idx/Makefile.dist/ contains
all commands for <idx/automake/, <idx/autoconf/ etc. to build your project. If you added files manually or changed macros yourself, you should run
Autoconf afterwards, followed by Configure to recreate all <idx/Makefile/s.<p>
<item><bf/Configure/ Executes the configure-script generated by <idx/autoconf/. If this command cannot be executed, run Autoconf and then
Configure again.<p>
</itemize>
<p>

<sect1>Calling <idx/Tools/
<p><nidx/"Tools"-menu/
The <idx/Tools/-menu contains by default the entries for the following programs if installed: <idx/KDbg/, <idx/KIconEdit/ and <idx/KTranslator/. These are
checked by the KDevelop installation program and inserted in the given order into the menu. Invoking a tool will open the
"Tools"-window and start the selected program inside this window. The <idx/Tools/ menu can be edited by the <idx/Tools/-entry in the Options-menu;
see <ref id="Configuring the Tools Menu" name="Configuring the Tools Menu">.

<sect1>Changing KDevelop's settings
<p><nidx/"Options"-menu/
The Options-menu contains all entries for invoking <idx/configuration dialog/s with which you can change KDevelop's default settings.
Major settings like those for the <idx/editor/ or <idx/printing/ have their own entries; general settings of KDevelop's behavior can be made
with the <ref id="KDevelop Setup" name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog.
<itemize>
<item><bf/Editor.../ Allows the configuration of the editor's behavior like word-breaking, selections etc.<p>
<item><bf/Editor Colors.../ Here, you can set the color-configuration of the <idx/editor/ like e.g. the background.<p>
<item><bf/Editor Defaults.../ This sets the default display like font and fontsize for the <idx/editor/<p>
<item><bf/Syntax-Highlighting / This dialog lets you configure the fonts and colors for the highlighting of several programming
languages, including <idx/HTML/.<p>
<item><bf/Documentation Browser/ In this tab-dialog, you can set the fonts, sizes and colors for the internal <idx/Helpbrowser/<p>
<item><bf/Configure Printer.../ Contains the entries for the printer <idx/configuration dialog/s.
<p>
<itemize>
<item><bf/<idx/enscript// Configures the printer for use with <idx/enscript/. See Printing for more information.<p>
</itemize>
<item><bf/<idx/Tools/.../ Opens the Configure <idx/Tools/ dialog. Here, you can configure the "<idx/Tools/" menu by adding or removing programs that will
be started in the <idx/Tools/-window.<p>
<item><bf/KDevelop Setup/ Opens the KDevelop Setup dialog. The first tabulator configures general settings, followed by the
key-configuration and the Documentation settings. The Documentation settings also include the generation of a new set of
<idx/HTML/-library documentation and the rebuilding of the <idx/search index/ for the <idx/Helpbrowser/.
</itemize>

<sect1>The Window Menu
<p><nidx/"Window"-menu/
The Window menu contains a list with all currently open files. This allows a quick switch to another file you're currently working
on.

<sect1>Managing Bookmarks
<p><nidx/"Bookmarks"-menu/
The Bookmarks menu is intended for adding and removing <idx/bookmarks/ you want to set in the current editing file. As KDevelop uses two
editing windows, each one configures it's <idx/bookmarks/ separately.
<itemize>
<item><bf/Set Bookmark/ Opens a context-menu with up to nine configurable <idx/bookmarks/. This allows setting a bookmark to a certain entry
in the <idx/bookmarks/ menu by logical reasons.<p>
<item><bf/Add Bookmark  Ctrl+Alt+A/ Adds the line of the current cursor position to the <idx/bookmarks/ menu as a bookmark. Mind that this
could overwrite a bookmark set with the Set Bookmark-option. If the browser is opened, a bookmark will be added to the
Browser-Window <idx/bookmarks/ menu.<p>
<item><bf/Clear Bookmarks Ctrl+Alt+C/ Clears the bookmark-entries for the top editing window or the browser, e.g. if
the Header-Window is visible and you call Clear Bookmarks, the entries for the Header-Window are deleted.<p>
<item><bf/Header-Window/ Contains the bookmark-list for the Header-Window. Selecting a bookmark will set the cursor to the selected
<idx/bookmarks/' line. Mind that <idx/bookmarks/ are only assigned to the file they are set to, so if you change to another file, the
<idx/bookmarks/ are not deleted but choosing a bookmark won't change to the file they are assigned to as well.<p>
<item><bf>C/C++-Window</bf> Contains the bookmark-list for the C/C++-Window. The preferences are the same as for the
Header-Window.
<item><bf>Browser Window</bf> Contains the browser <idx/bookmarks/. Selecting a bookmark will open the browser with the selected page.
</itemize>

<sect1><idx/Online Help/
<p><nidx/Help-menu/
The Help-menu contains entries for navigating in the <idx/Helpbrowser/ as well as entries for library and online-documentation for the
most recently used cases. Accessing additional online-documentation can be achieved with the <idx/DOC/-tree in the treeview
automatically opened (if Autoswitch is enabled) when changing to the Documentation Browser window.
<itemize>
<item><bf/<idx/Back/  Alt+ Left Arrow/ Opens the page opened before the actual one.<p>
<item><bf/<idx/Forward/ Alt+ Right Arrow/ Opens the next page of the browser-history, available after a "Back"-action.<p>
<item><bf/<idx/Search Marked Text/		F2/ Scans the search-index for text currently marked in the editing windows or the browser-window.
After the search, a result page is shown which lets you select the help-page to switch to. After choosing a page, the browser will
highlight the found entry for the expression the search was invoked for. With the F3 key the next <idx/search result/ on the same page
will be displayed if more than one hit was reported for the search on one page.<p>
<item><bf/<idx/Search for Help on...//Opens the Search for Help on... dialog that lets you search for a specific expression you want
help on.
<p>
<item><bf/<idx/The User Manual to KDevelop/		<idx/F1// Opens the User's Manual to KDevelop index page (this handbook).
<p>
<item><bf/<idx/The KDevelop Programming Handbook//
Opens the <htmlurl url="programming/index.html" name="KDevelop Programming Handbook">

information about the most recent KDE development and how to prepare your application to be KDE 2-ready.
<p>
<item><bf>C/C++ <idx/Reference/</bf> Displays the language reference index page. If the
reference is not installed, an error page shows you how to get the reference and how to install it correctly.

<p>
<item><bf/<idx/Tip of the Day// Opens the Tip of the Day dialog to inform you about KDevelop's
features.
<p>
<item><bf/<idx/KDevelop Homepage// Opens the KDevelop Homepage in the browser window if Internet access is provided.
<p>
<item><bf/<idx/Bug Report/.../ Opens the KDevelop Bug Report dialog, where you can send a bug-report directly to the KDevelop Team by
email. See <ref id="Bug Reporting" name="Bug Reporting">
<p>

email-addresses as well as reference to the licensing of KDevelop.
</itemize>

<sect><idx/Toolbar/ Items
<p>
KDevelop provides quick access to a various set of commands by it's toolbars. These are the standard and the browser toolbar.
Both can be en-/disabled by the according menu entries in the "View" menu; also
dragged out of the main window and replaced on each side of the working area.

<sect1>The Standard <idx/Toolbar/
<p>
The standard toolbar provides quick access to the most recently used functions for file processing and editing as well as building your
application. The buttons execute the following commands from left to right:
<nidx/"File"-menu/<nidx/"Edit"-menu/<nidx/"Project"-menu"/<nidx/"Build"-menu/<nidx/debugging/<nidx/Tree-View/<nidx/Output-View/<nidx/execute target/

<itemize>
<item>Open Project - shows the open project dialog
<item>Open File - shows the open file dialog and contains a delayed popup to fast select the current project header and source files.
<item>Save File - saves the currently opened file to disk
<item>Print File - opens the printer dialog
<item>(separator)
<item>Undo - reverts the last action
<item>Redo - executes a reverted action again
<item>Cut - cuts out the current selection
<item>Copy - copies the current selection to the system clipboard
<item>Paste - pastes the current clipboard contents to the actual cursor position
<item>(separator)
<item><idx/Compile File/ - compiles the file currently visible in the source file window. In Dialogeditor mode replaced by the Generate Files
button.
<item>Make - invokes make on the project
<item>Rebuild All - rebuilds the project
<item>Debug - opens <idx/KDbg/ with the application binary for <idx/debugging/ in the <idx/Tools/- window
<item>Execute - runs the application target binary
<item>Stop - cancels the current process
<item>(separator)
<item>Dialogeditor - switches to Dialogeditor mode. There, the button is replaced by a Sourcecode <idx/editor/ button
<item>Tree-View - en-/disables the treeview and works as a toggle button to display the current state
<item>Output-View - en-/disables the <idx/output/ view and works as a toggle button to display the current state
<item>(separator)
<item>What's this..? help button - changes the cursor to a question arrow and lets you get information about <idx/GUI/ components of KDevelop
</itemize>

<sect1>The Browser <idx/Toolbar/
<p>
The <idx/browser/ toolbar is another toolbar that provides a lot of useful commands for browsing files and the <idx/documentation/. The
toolbar contains:
<nidx/documentation browser/<nidx/Help-menu"/
<itemize>
<item>the Class combo box - lets you select a class of the current project to browse to
<item>the Method combo box - lets you select a method of the current class and browses to the <idx/implementation/ of the method
<item>the Class-assistant button - on a single click will bring you to the <idx/declaration/ of the method currently selected. Contains a
delayed popup to access the Classtools for adding Classes, Methods and Attributes as well as the browsing commands.
<item>Back - browses back in the <idx/documentation browser/ history; contains a delayed popup to select a certain page of the back history.
<item>Forward - browses forward in the <idx/documentation browser/ history; contains a delayed popup to select a certain page of the forward
history.
<item>Stop - stops the browser from loading a documentation file request
<item>Reload - reloads the currently displayed page
<item>Home - opens the KDevelop User Manual index page in the browser
<item>Search Marked Text - searches the documentation index for the selected text; works with the browser and the <idx/editor/ windows
<item>Search for Help on... - opens the the Search for Help on.. dialog to let you enter a keyword to search in the documentation
</itemize>

<chapt>The Help System<label id="The Help System">
<p>
Most of KDevelop's strength is accumulated in the Help System.  It is also to be understood as an example of how to extend your own
KDE application with a complete set of help functionality, and is, in part, already realized in the template applications, so
KDE/Qt <idx/application framework/s generated with the <idx/KAppWizard/ do already contain the basic functionality for statusbar help and
documentation, that only has to be extended by the programmer. This section therefore introduces into the usage of the general
help provided within the IDE as well as to show the usage of the <idx/Helpbrowser/, which, by intelligent use, will make it very easy to
get the information you need for development.

<sect>The "What's this ?"-Button and <idx/Quickhelp/
<p>
Looking at KDevelop's top toolbar, you will see the "What's this?" button on the right end. By selecting the button, the cursor
will change to a pointer with a question mark on the right, as is the same as the button in the toolbar. Now, you can select any
visible part of the KDevelop user interface and click on it. This will result in displaying a help-window giving you a short
description of the function this part gives you or what it can do for you. Included are the main view, the tree-views and the
toolbars, for which every button help is provided. After another mouse click or a keyboard input, the What's this? help window
disappears and your cursor is set to the last active position. Mind, that, if you place the mouse pointer over a button, it gets
raised and after a short time, you will get a Quick-Tip-window, describing the function the button represents in the menubar; this
will disappear if you move the mouse pointer away.

For user interaction dialogs, <idx/Quickhelp/ provides you help windows with a short description of the selected item you want help for.
These are accessed by a right-button mouse click to the item, a context-menu pops up that allows the selection of "Quick-Help".
Selecting this will pop up the help window. This is always useful for dialogs where you can't see the action's purpose for as long
as you are not familiar with KDevelop. Mind that most dialogs offer a Help-button which will show you the detailed context-help
for the dialog's options within the provided online-manual in the help-browser.

<sect> The <idx/Statusbar/ Help
<p>
The statusbar of KDevelop offers you many functions that inform you about the current activity state as well as "status messages"
offering a short description for commands.

<sect1> <idx/Statusbar/ Entries
<p>
The <idx/Statusbar/ contains:
<enum>
<item> a general message field, most left. This is used for help messages and displays the current activity.
<item> the progressbar, indicating the progress for actions that require a comparably long time to be finished, such as saving
files and the scan-progress of the Class Browser. The progressbar only appears during those processes are executed.
<item> an Insert/Overwrite indicator. It shows the <idx/editor/ mode for insert actions by INS for Insert mode and OVR for Overwrite
mode. The mode can be changed by the INS-key on the keyboard.
<item> a line counter, displaying the current line the cursor is placed.
<item> a column counter, indicating the current column position of the cursor in a line.
</enum>

<sect1> Help Messages
<p>
The statusbar informs you about the action of menu entries if you select a menu within the menubar and select an action without
executing it. Further, if you press on a toolbar icon, but without releasing the mousebutton, the help message for the button is
displayed in the same way as for the menu entries. You can prevent the execution of the selected icon by moving the mousepointer
away from the icon, still holding the button pressed. If the cursor is away, release the mousebutton.

For actions that are currently executed, KDevelop displays the action. This counts for processes running in the background
such as saving files as well as for dialogs. If the process has exited such as a make-invocation, the statusbar display
changes back to "Ready" state.

Also, when using the <idx/documentation browser/, the statusbar displays link urls for as long as the cursor is placed over an URL link
in the browser window. Therefore, you can easily find out if the file is a local or a remote file only accessed by network
connection.

The caption of the KDevelop Project Editor shows you the currently opened filename in the top window. This would be a <idx/HTML/ file
for the <idx/documentation browser/ or a text file for the editing windows. Further, the Project name is displayed, so you have constant
control where you are and what you're currently working at.

<sect> Configuring the <idx/HTML/ Browser
<p>
The browser included in KDevelop is completely <idx/HTML/-based, therefore you can specify the usual options like background and the
like. You can set all preferences by the "Documentation Browser"-entry of the "Options"-menu.
The <idx/configuration dialog/ shows you two tabulators; the first for setting the font preferences, the second for color selection.

<sect1>Font Preferences
<p>
The first option for the font display is the size. Available are small, medium and large. The best display for normal use
is set to small by default.
For the font selection you have to specify a standard font for normal text as it appears in <idx/HTML/ documents; the fixed font is the
one used for displaying e.g. code within the <idx/HTML/ file.

<sect1>Color Preferences
<p>
The color preferences dialog allows configuration of background, normal text, URL Link and followed link color. The
colored buttons on the right are displaying the current settings; selecting a button will result in opening the "Select Color"
dialog. There, you can specify the color either by choosing a System Color, a custom color, select the color by the multi-colored
window or by setting the values directly. The middle contains a preview for the color selected.

Further, you can specify if the browser should underline links to easier detect them visually and if you like to use your own
colors always independent of the page's preset ones. "Apply" will execute all changes, while "OK" will apply changes and close the
dialog. "Cancel" leaves all settings untouched and exits the configuration.

<sect> Using the Documentation Browser<label id="Using the Documentation Browser">
<p>
The <idx/documentation browser/ allows quick and easy access to all manuals and documentations that are provided with KDevelop or
generated automatically, including online-documentation for the <idx/KDE-libraries/ and your project documentation. Plus, the
Documentation Tree in the tree-view lets you customize a special "Others" folder that contains all individually added
documentation.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
To make use of all features of the <idx/Helpbrowser/, you should have <idx/KDoc/ and <idx/glimpse/ installed. <idx/KDoc/ will generate all kind of online
class-documentation for the <idx/KDE-libraries/ during the <idx/setup/ process, but can also invoked by option in the <ref id="General
Configuration" name="KDevelop Setup">. For the generation of an <idx/API/ (Application Programming Interface) Documentation for your
project's <idx/classes/, <idx/KDoc/ is also used and called by the Project-menu, entry "Make <idx/API/-Doc". This will process all current header files
of the project plus the addition of a cross-reference to the Qt and <idx/KDE-libraries/ if those are available in the <idx/Helpbrowser/. For
the generation of the project handbooks, you should have <idx/KSgml2Html/ (provided with the <idx/KDE-SDK/) and, as a minimum, <idx/SGML/-tools
installed on your system. To extend and change your project's online-documentation, you have to edit the documentation file for your
project by selecting it in the <idx/RFV/. After saving your changes, call "Make User-Manual" from the Project-menu. In case <idx/SGML/tools detect
formatting <idx/errors/, those will be displayed in the <idx/output/ window allow you to find the error line directly. The program "<idx/glimpse/"
is used to create a personal search-index for your documentation automatically. The index is generally build during the
installation process, but can also be build with the <ref id="General Configuration" name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog. For a description of
the provided search functions see <ref id="Using the Searchindex" name="Using the Searchindex">.

<sect1>Provided Documentation
<p>
The KDevelop IDE comes with two sets of online-documentation, which can be accessed either via the Help-menu or by the Doc-tree in
the Tree-View in the KDevelop folder. The first book provided is this online-handbook containing all information you need towards
installation, configuration, available functionality and introduction to application development. The second book is <htmlurl
url="programming/index.html" name="The KDevelop Programming Handbook"> in it's first edition. The programming handbook covers most
questions related to the creation and extension of projects that work with KDevelop. By tutorials the user gets an introduction to the
rich facilities that applications created with the Qt- and/or <idx/KDE-libraries/ have to offer as well as given a guideline for
ensuring <idx/KDE/-compliance, which covers the same instructions given on the Internet site at <url url="http://developer.kde.org">.
However, the programming handbook cannot replace any additional documentation available in printed or electronic form about the C++
programming language as well as about the usage of the Qt-library in certain terms.

The C/C++-<idx/Reference/ used with KDevelop is currently only available on the KDevelop homepage at <url
url="http://www.kdevelop.org">. On distributions the reference may be included, see your distribution installation program index for
more information. It can be installed easily by downloading and copying the sourcefile to the main KDE-directory ($KDEDIR). There, you
have to untar it as root with <tt/tar zxvf c_c++_reference.tar.gz/, the reference will then be copied the documentation directory of
KDevelop. For uninstalling the reference documentation you just have to delete the "reference" folder under
($KDEDIR)/share/doc/HTML/default/kdevelop/reference.

The Qt/<idx/KDE-libraries/ documentation folder allows direct access to the <idx/HTML/-online documentation of your copy of the
Qt-library. The path to the library documentation is usually automatically detected by the KDevelop installation program, but can be
set manually in the <ref id="General Configuration" name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog. Also, all available documentation for the
<idx/KDE-libraries/ are listed in order of the library name, so if you would use <idx/classes/ of a certain library it is easy to
determine the library type to be added to the <idx/Linker/ settings in the project. Mind that the whole KDE-Library documentation is
only accessible when generated by <idx/KDoc/- so this program, included in the <idx/KDE-SDK/, has to be installed before the
documentation can be generated. As the installation program of KDevelop does this automatically, it should be installed before running
the KDevelop Setup. If this is not the case and the documentation cannot be build, you are able to create it afterwards at any time
with the <ref id="General Configuration" name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog.

The documentation tree also contains the "Others" folder which is intended to contain all personally customized
documentation as described below. Finally, the Doc-Tree allows access to the <idx/API/ and the Manual for your current
project.

<sect1>Adding Documentation to the <idx/Helpbrowser/
<p>
To customize your <idx/Helpbrowser/, open the Tree-View and select the "<idx/DOC/" Tabulator. You will see an opened tree containing four folders.
The "Others" folder is, by default, empty. On a right mousebutton click over this folder, a context menu opens that has an entry "Add
Entry". Select this to open the Add Entry dialog where you have to enter two values: the upper one for the name that will be displayed
for the documentation within the Doc-tree, and, below that, a file-entry line. Here, you have to enter the path and filename to the
start page that will be opened by the selection of the entry later. You can enter the path and filename directly or by selection of the
pushbutton on the right to open a file-chooser dialog. This allows a quick browsing on your system to the path for your start page. Mind
that only <idx/HTML/-documentation can be selected, so only <idx/HTML/ files are allowed to choose. Selecting OK will add the entry to the Doc-tree
and is available directly.

<sect1>Using the Searchindex<label id="Using the Searchindex">
<p>
KDevelop includes a set of functions to help you search information within <idx/HTML/ documentation. To use these features, your system
needs to have the program "<idx/glimpse/", a free database generator, installed, which creates the <idx/search index/ and executes searches
within the documentation. To set up the index, see <ref id="General Configuration" name="KDevelop Setup">. The index is also
automatically generated during the installation program.

The search functions are available through several ways which you can choose from:
<enum>
<item>in the <idx/editor/, select the text you want to have help on or place the cursor in the word that you want to look for. Then
press the right mouse button and select look up: "expression" This can also be done by selecting "Search Marked Text" from the
Help-menu, the shortcut key F2 or by selecting the Search icon from the toolbar.
<item>in the Documentation browser select the text you want to look up and press the right mouse button, select look
up:"expression" or select "Search Marked Text" or the search icon as above.
<item>if you want to search for a specific keyword, select "Search for Help on..." in the Help-menu or select the "Search for Help
on..." icon from the toolbar, opening a search dialog where you can enter the expression you want to get information for.
</enum>
Direct access to specific documentation is given by selecting the according icon in the "<idx/DOC/" -tree-view or by the Help-menu
entries.

The <idx/Helpbrowser/ also offers support for <idx/grep/ to search for a selection within your current project, e.g you've opened the documentation
page for the <tt/KTMainWindow/ class (KDEUI library) and you want to know where in your code <tt/KTMainWindow/ appears. Mark
<tt/KTMainWindow/ and either select "Grep: KTMainWindow" or press Shift+F2. The "Search in Files" dialog opens with the results about
your <idx/grep/ search directly. Then you can choose an result line to jump to the according sourcecode.

<chapt>Working with the Editor<label id="Working with the Editor">
<p>
An important part of the integrated development environment is the <idx/editor/. You're using it for:
<itemize>
<item>creating, opening and saving source and <idx/project files/
<item>editing source and <idx/project files/
<item>writing your <idx/SGML/ documentation
<item><idx/printing/ your <idx/project files/
</itemize>
Generally, the <idx/editor/ itself doesn't do much difference in comparison to other editors; especially as it is a build-in version of
the popular KWrite, also known as the "Extended Editor". If you're familiar with that, you won't have any problems using it for
managing your projects. In addition to normal editors, KDevelop contains a new <idx/printing/ system, that is far more extended for use
with sourcecodes- and you can choose between the <idx/printing/ program you want to use.

This section gives you more information about how to handle your <idx/project files/ and to make you more familiar with the <idx/editor/'s
functionality. A lot of Unix-hardliners would prefer using Emacs or XEmacs- they're fine with that. But it isn't necessary for
easy programming, and especially for beginners, to work themselves into powerful editors which shall, in the result, only allow
you to enter your code.

<sect>Managing Project Files
<p>
The following sections describe how to create, save, open and close your <idx/project files/ you need to edit- mind that this doesn't
include translation files or <idx/pixmaps/. Those are recognized automatically and the according editing program like <idx/KTranslator/ opens
those files for you.

To give you an easy access to your files, KDevelop contains two easy-to-handle tree-views, similar to a filemanager, that recognize
if you selected a file, and opens it in the according <idx/editor/ window. The main view contains two windows that are used
independently, but connected via the Project Editor, so you can do all menubar actions the same way. The intention behind this is
that it allows you to handle two windows at the same time, although only one is visible. The C/C++ window thereby takes another
task, which allows you to easily compile your sources one by one, so you can check the implementations without having to run a
complete build-process over your project.

This can be done when having the C/C++ window on top. Select "<idx/Compile File/" from the Build-menu or press the according button in
the toolbar. Your file gets saved and compiled, and you can control any <idx/errors/ by the <idx/Compiler/ <idx/output/ in the <idx/output/ window.

Within the IDE you can open as many text files as you like. All opened files are listed in the Window-menu, so you can switch
between them by selecting the according filename from the menu. Further, the actual opened file is displayed with its name in the
window frame of KDevelop.

<sect1>Creating and Saving Files
<p>
To create a new file, choose "New" from the File-menu. This opens the "<idx/New File/" dialog, where you can specify the filename and type.
Additionally, you have to set the destination directory as well if the file is added to the project or not. Finally, you can also use
your header template for the project in case you want to add a new sourcefile without generating a new class by the Class-Generator.

After the file has been created, you can edit the new file as usual; if you have to switch between different files, you can always
turn back to the file either via the file-trees or by the Window-menu.

For saving any changes, KDevelop offers a whole variety of options. The standard way would be to save the file by selecting "Save"
or "Save As" from the File-menu or by the Save-button on the toolbar. For saving all changed files at once, you could as well
select "Save all" from the File-menu.

Now, when working on a project, it is very annoying if something critical happens while you have done a lot of changes on your
files; sometimes you will bite yourself that you have forgotten to save the changes. KDevelop takes care of this by offering
"Autosaving", which is by default enabled and set to save all files in intervals of 5 minutes. To select another saving period or
to disable this, see <ref id="KDevelop Setup" name="KDevelop Setup">, where the <idx/setup/ options are described.

Additionally, KDevelop takes care for all changes if you open another project or exit KDevelop. You will be asked for saving the
changed files, where you also have the option to specify which one to save and which you want to stay unsaved. Further, when
invoking any build-processes, your files get saved automatically, so you won't ever wonder why your application doesn't run the
way you expected it to do after your changes to the source files. The only exception is the "<idx/Compile File/" command, which only
saves the currently opened source file visible in the source <idx/editor/ window.

<sect1>Opening and Closing Files
<p>
To open a source file, you have a lot of options as well. One way could be, as the standard for editors, to select "Open" from the
File-menu. You will be presented an "Open File" dialog, which allows you to choose the file you want to edit. Another, probably
more frequently used way is to select the file from the <idx/LFV/, the Logical File Viewer, or the <idx/RFV/, the Real File Viewer (see <ref
id="Overview">). The advantage of the file trees is that they provide a quick visual access to your files, especially the <idx/LFV/,
which only displays your <idx/project files/ by their type, collected into folders. You can as well configure the <idx/LFV/ towards sorting
your files in another manner by a right mouse click on the tree. Select "New Group" from the popup-menu, and you can configure a
new group, or select "Edit Group" to install new file filters by specifying the group's file extensions, separated by commas.

The standard file groups for a project generated by <idx/KAppWizard/ are the Headers, Sources, GNU and Others. Additionally, after
adding a translation file, KDevelop adds a folder "Translations", containing your *.po files.

To close files, select the file to close from the Window-menu, which loads the opened file into the front <idx/editor/. Then select
"Close" from the File-menu. If your file has been changed, you will be asked to save it. When closing a project, all currently
opened files will be checked for changes and you will be asked for saving as well.

<sect>Navigating within Files
<p>
The following gives you a general guideline how to locate certain positions within your files for a quicker access.

<bf>&raquo How to find a certain line in a file</bf>

<enum>
<item>Select "Goto Line" in the "View"-menu or press CTRL+G. The dialogfield "Goto Line" appears.
<item>Insert the linenumber you want to go to.
<item>Press OK.
</enum>

<bf>&raquo How to set a bookmark</bf>

<enum>
<item>Set the cursor to the line you want to access via a bookmark
<item>Select "Set Bookmark" from the "Bookmarks"-menu.
<item>A popup-menu opens that allows you to select the bookmark number you want to set for the new bookmark.
<item>Select the bookmark number.
</enum>

Another way to set <idx/bookmarks/ would be to select "Add Bookmark" from the "Bookmarks"-menu. This sets a bookmark to the current line
and appends it to the <idx/bookmarks/-list. The <idx/documentation browser/ also offers setting a bookmark to the current page by a context menu
entry "Add Bookmark".

<bf>&raquo How to delete <idx/bookmarks/</bf>

The <idx/bookmarks/ are set for each editing window separately- mind that your <idx/bookmarks/ aren't connected to a certain file you set the
bookmark for. To delete all bookmarks, select "Delete Bookmarks" from the "Bookmarks"-menu. This deletes the <idx/bookmarks/ for the
window actually on top, either the Header window, the C++ window or the browser window.

<bf>&raquo How to go to a bookmarked line</bf>

<enum>
<item>Select the "Bookmarks"-menu and open the popup menu containing the <idx/bookmarks/ for the window containing the bookmark you want
to view.
<item>Press ALT+number (of the bookmark)
</enum>

Selecting a bookmark for the browser window will open the browser and loads the page.

<sect>Working with Keyboard Shortcuts
<p>
For using the <idx/editor/, you should make yourself comfortable with some keyboard <idx/shortcuts/ that make it easier to position the cursor
and edit the file. The complete shortcut reference is also listed in section <ref id="Overview" name="Overview">.

<sect>Edit Windows Settings
<p>
The <idx/editor/ inside KDevelop can be configured towards special editing needs with a global effect on all editing windows. Thereby
you can set the color modes, highlighting colors (also configurable in reference to the programming language of the file) and
automatic text settings like tab-with and selection modes. The following describes how to set these options by the configuration
dialogs provided in the "Options"-menu.

<sect1>General Settings
<p>
The <idx/editor/'s general settings can be configured with the "Editor" entry in the "Options"-menu. Select the according values and
press OK after you finished with your configuration.

<sect2>Edit Options
<p>
<descrip>
<tag/Auto Indent:/	this sets the editor to place the cursor below the first literal when a new line is entered.
<p>
<tag/Backspace Indent:/ this option sets the cursor below the first literal of the line above when backspace is pressed.
<p>
<tag/Word Wrap:/ words are taken into the next line after the column set in "Wrap Words At:"
<p>
<tag/Replace Tabs:/ tabulators in the current text are replaced with tabulators of the "Tab Width:" value
<p>
<tag/Remove Trailing Spaces:/removes trailing spaces
<p>
<tag/Wrap Cursor:/ sets the cursor to the end of the last line when backspace enters the beginning of a line
<p>
<tag/Auto Brackets:/ creates a closing bracket in front of the cursor when a bracket (any kind) is opened.
</descrip>

<sect2>Select Options
<p>
<descrip>
<tag/Persistent Selections:/ selections made stay marked after setting the cursor to a different place
<p>
<tag/Multiple Selections:/ allows multiple independent selections within the text
<p>
<tag/Vertical Selections:/ allows vertical selections of text
<p>
<tag/Delete On Input:/ deletes a selection when writing in the selection.
<p>
<tag/Toggle Old:/ allows only one selection. A selection made gets deselected when another selection is made.
<p>
<tag/Wrap Words At:/ sets the maximum columns that a line can have. The word that contains a letter that reaches over this value
will be automatically broken into the next line.
</descrip>

<sect1>Colors
<p>
For changing the <idx/editor/'s general appearance, you can define a set of colors that the editor uses by selecting "Editor Colors"
from the "Options"-menu. You can configure colors for:
<itemize>
<item><bf/background:      /        the editor's background
<item><bf/text background:  /     	the background of displayed text
<item><bf/selected:         /       the color of selected text
<item><bf/found:            /       the color of text found by a search via the menu "Edit"-"Search", "Repeat search" and "Replace".
<item><bf/selected + found: /       the color of text selected to search for and found
</itemize>

<sect1>Syntax Highlighting
<p>
The syntax-highlighting mode of KDevelop's <idx/editor/ can be configured by two dialogs; first you can set default colors for
syntax-highlighting by the "Editor Defaults" entry in the "Options"-menu. There, you can set colors and fonts as well as the
fontsize for e.g. keywords. Select the default item and set all needed options.

The second <idx/configuration dialog/ is accessed by the "Syntax-Highlighting" entry in the "Options"-menu. This allows you to set the
file filters for the programming language, e.g. *.cpp, *.h  for C++. Then select the item that you want to configure. If you wish
to use the default values you've set in the "Editor Defaults" dialog, select the "default" checkboxes in the Item-style and
Item-Font sections. This reads the default settings for the selected item. After pressing OK, your new values will be enabled and
used by the <idx/editor/.

<sect>Searching and Replacing
<p>
<sect1>Single File Search
<p>
<bf>&raquo How to find one or more characters in the actual editing window</bf>
<enum>
<item>Select "Search" from the "Edit"-menu. This opens the search dialog.
<item>Specify the expression to search for in the edit field. The drop-down menu offers selecting a previous search expression.
<item>Select additional options like "Whole Words only"
<item>Press OK.
</enum>

To repeat searching for an expression entered in the search dialog, press F3.

<sect1>Searching over Several Files
<p>
As the search function only is referencing searches over a single file that is currently visible, you're limited to this. But often
you want to search for the same expression overall your project. Therefore, KDevelop contains a <tt/<idx/grep//-dialog, which
lets you search over all files that you specify either by setting the directory to start the search from and/or by mime-type.
Specifying the exact directory and the mime-type will therefore reduce the time that KDevelop needs to read your files and display
the results. To start a search over several files, select "Search in files..." from the "Edit"-menu. The search dialog opens and
lets you enter:

<itemize>
<item>The expression to search for (the pattern)
<item>The template used for the search
<item>The mime-type of files to search in
<item>The directory to start form
<item>If the search is recursive over all included subdirectories
</itemize>

By default, the <idx/grep/-dialog is set to start at your project directory and works recursively over <idx/implementation/ and header files.

You can even extend your search pattern by using the following options:

<enum>
<item><bf/./ Match any character
<item><bf/^/ Match the beginning of a line
<item><bf/$/ Match the end of a line
<item><bf/\< / Match the beginning of a word
<item><bf/\> / Match the end of a word
</enum>

For a repeating search, you can also use the available operators:
<enum>
<item><bf/?/ The preceding item matches less than once
<item><bf/*/ The preceding item is matched zero or more times
<item><bf/+/ The preceding item is matched once or more times
<item><bf/{ n }/ The preceding item is matched exactly <em/n/ times
<item><bf/{ n,}/ The preceding item is matched <em/n/ or more times
<item><bf/{,n }/ The preceding item matches less than <em/n/ times
<item><bf/{n,m}/ The preceding item matches at least <em/n/ times but less than <em/m/ times
</enum>

Backreferences to bracketed subexpressions are also available by the notation <em/\n/.

After specifying your search, press "Search". The results are then displayed in the result-window. To jump to a file and line
number, select the resultline and press Enter or double click the result. The editor will automatically open the according file
and place the cursor to the line of the result. This allows a complete specification for any search action and give out exact
results.

KDevelop offers also some more specialized functionality to use <idx/grep/ within the <idx/editor/s and the browser. Select the expression you want
to search for in either of the windows and press SHIFT+F2 or select "<idx/grep/:&lt;your_expression&gt;" from the right button popup menu.
This will ask <idx/grep/ to search for the selection in your project directory's files and will show the results immediately. Switching to
the result works as described above. From within the editor window, it lasts to place the cursor over a word and start searching; the
word under the cursor will be the search pattern.

<sect1>Searching within Documentation
<p>
While working on a project, you often need to have information about the parameters of <idx/member functions/ you want to use- most
often you remember the function's name that matches your needs, but the parameters are a very hard thing to keep in mind.
Therefore, and for other purposes that may occur, KDevelop contains a search functionality that combines searching expressions
that appear in your files with the <idx/documentation browser/. To make use of this search functionality, you should have set up the
<idx/documentation browser/ correctly and created the search database. For invoking a search through the documentation, do the
following:

<enum>
<item>place your cursor at the word you want to search or mark an expression
<item>select "Search Marked Text" from the <idx/Help-menu/ or press the right mouse button to open the context menu; then select
"Look Up: "expression".
<item>after the <idx/search result/ page is displayed in the <idx/documentation browser/, select the page that you think could contain the
information you need.
<item>the selected documentation page is displayed and your <idx/search result/ is marked. To display the next result within the same
documentation page, press F3.
</enum>

This allows you to easily find the information you need. For using the results, the <idx/documentation browser/ allows marking a
selection and copying it to the clipboard. Then return to the file you're editing and select "Paste" from the "Edit"-menu.

For a full description on how to use the Documentation, see <ref id="Using the Searchindex" name="Using the Searchindex">.

<sect1>Replacing Text
<p>
For replacing an expression, select "Search and Replace" from the "Edit"-menu. The "Search and Replace"-dialog lets you specify
the expression to be replaced as well as the replacement expression. Then press OK. The first expression which is found will be
marked, so you can see where the expression is and in which context. Then you can specify by a dialog if the expression shall be
replaced or not. When the search is finished by reaching the end of the current file, you will be asked if you want to start the
search again from the beginning. If you're finished, select "Cancel".

<sect>Printing
<p>
As KDevelop is designed to give developers the best access to files and information to reduce development cycles, it also contains
a new printing utility which makes use of <em/enscript/, a common printing program available for Unix-Systems.
Besides, you can also print by directly using lpr (the lineprinter device). As using enscript offers the
most options towards printing, you should install it on your system; it is usually shipped with
distributions, so you shouldn't have any problem to get it. But before printing, you should have a look at the available
configuration dialog to prepare the output according to your needs. The following section describes how to configure KDevelop for
printing files.

<sect1>Configuring the Printer
<p>
The <idx/printing/ program can be configured by selecting "Print" from the <idx/"File"-menu/; on the <idx/printing/ dialog,
select the program by the drop-down-menu in the left upper corner. Then press the "Options" button on the right. This opens the
configuration for the program.  Another way to configure the program is selecting "Printer
Configuration..." from the "Options"-menu; then select "<idx/enscript/".

<sect2>Print Preview
<p>
Print Preview is available for you to control how the <idx/output/ will look like. Therefore, KDevelop uses the program <em/ghostview/ or
<em/kghostview/. When the preview-button was pressed on either <idx/printing/ dialog, you will be presented a template <idx/output/ that shows you
the effect of the currently set options.

<sect1>Programs
<p>
KDevelop creates a projectfile with the .kdevprj ending. This file contains all your project information, so be careful not to
delete it. It is stored in the project's base directory and has to be opened to load the project. The projectfile keeps all
information for your files like the file properties, install path, distribution status and <idx/compiler options/ (CXXFLAGS). Setting
file properties allows you to keep track of where the files should go.

With <idx/KAppWizard/, you can create a new application project according to your choice of application type. For now, <idx/KAppWizard/
generates four kinds of frame applications, as:

<itemize>
<item>a single document interface (SDI) <idx/KDE/-application including a menubar, a toolbar and a statusbar. It contains basic control
resource management to allow extending the frame application into a unique <idx/KDE/ application. The application frame also
contains statusbar help messages as known from commercial products just like KDevelop itself. From the programmer's point of view,
it is based on three application-specific <idx/classes/ leaning on the MVC-concept (Model-View-Controller). Technically, the base
<idx/classes/ may not be viewed that way, but it's construction is at least created most logical to create applications with a <idx/GUI/.

<item>a <idx/KDE/-based application frame window. This application type offers most flexibility to those wanting to develop their
program from scratch, but can also be used as a basis for developing wizard applications or modules.

<item>a Qt-only based program framework. For those programmers who want to use the <idx/Qt-library/ as the <idx/GUI/ interface alone, we
tried to offer you a smart framework to support your application development. As Qt programming is fully supported, you should
have no problems to create a full-functional application by using Qt only.

<item>a C++ program framework. This application type is intended for those wanting to write a terminal based C++ program. Just
remove the "Hello World" line in main() and construct your <idx/classes/ the same way with KDevelop as for <idx/KDE/ applications.
<item>a C program framework for C programmers. This is as well a terminal based application but only uses the C compiler.
</itemize>

Further, KDevelop allows you to create projects for KDE 2 and Qt 2.x. These projects require installing the
required libraries as well as setting the according installation path in the KDevelop Setup dialog (see <ref
id="General Configuration" name="General Configuration">) before generating a project to ensure everything
will work automatically. The KDevelop 1.4 Appwizard adds a GNOME-template so that developers wanting
to use KDevelop to create GTK+-based applications can do so as well.

Additionally, KDevelop enables you to work with already existing projects. Those can have any options set by the programmer himself by
configure and Makefiles. As far as the execution and the build-process is concerned, the current state only allows the same structure
as for the other baseclasses. Create a custom project with the application wizard and add your files to the project to allow scanning
by the classbrowser.

To ensure the build process, your custom project has to have all sources in a subdirectory matching the lowercase name of your project;
the execution of the binary is also restricted to this lowercase project name.

Mind that KDevelop does not write any information into Makefiles or configuration files. You are responsible for any project behavior
and build settings yourself.

<sect1>Libraries
<p>
A general project-type to create libraries is not available at the moment. Anyway, building libraries is not impossible with KDevelop.
Here are a few guidelines and workarounds:

<itemize>
<item>Whenever your project subdirectory gets another subdirectory that contains source files, KDevelop will build a static library of
these. That means static libraries are already supported by automatic creation in order to sort project sourcefiles.
Mind that the static library is part of the binary later and won't get installed.
<item>to create a shared library KDevelop offers an easy way to turn a such created static library into a shared: Open the RFV on the
left of KDevelop큦 main window and browse to the created subdirectory. There, use the right mouse button over the subdirectory. The
popup-menu offers the following options:
<itemize>
<item>update Makefile.am
<item>change to static lib
<item>change to shared lib
</itemize>
Use "change to shared lib" to convert the default generated static library into a shared one. You can reverse your decision later if
you decide that using it as a static library will work as well for your project- just do the same steps again and select "change to
static lib".
</itemize>

<sect1>Multiple Targets
<p>

For some projects, the facilities of KDevelop at it's current state will not last. Those are projects that include multiple
targets like packages containing several applications. As commands like "Execute" require that only one target is build by the
developer, those types of projects are only supported in the way that you have to write your own entries to the <idx/Makefile.am/'s and
creating your directories for the additional libraries or binaries to build. Nevertheless, a build-process always invokes your
make-program independent from what actually the targets are; so these functions still can be used (with the restriction that the build
is invoked from the main project subdirectory).

Another way to still work with this type and to still have access to the binaries themselves are creating empty projects and move their
subdirectories in conjunction with the <idx/project files/ to the directory containing all sources later. Then you could load each
target independently by its project file; this also allows executing and <idx/debugging/ the target.

Multiple binaries or libraries within the main project subdirectory are possible with following the rules explained in section <ref
id="Project Hacking" name="Project Hacking"> and the following guidelines for editing the main project's subdirectory Makefile.am (all
modifications outside the KDevelop write area):

<itemize>
<item>add your target to the bin_PROGRAMS if it is an executable
<item>add your library declaration line if it is a shared library
<item>add the same declarations like the original project binary is build:
	<itemize>
	<item>newtarget_METASOURCES
	<item>newtarget_LD_FLAGS
	<item>DISTCLEANFILES
	<item>copy the messages: entry for the original binary and replace target_SOURCES with newtarget_SOURCES, target.pot with
newtarget.pot
	</itemize>
<item>add your sources like the KDevelop write area contains outside the write area for your binary or library
<item>for installing static libraries, create the library with KDevelop's auto-creation inside subdirectories. Then modify the
Makefile.am outside the write area according to the needed settings
</itemize>

<sect> <idx/New Project/s
<p>

The KDevelop Application Wizard allows the creation of different types of projects, constructing a framework for each. All
projects use the GNU standard development tools as described in the requirements section of this handbook.

For <idx/KDE/ applications there are six different frameworks:
<itemize>
<item>Mini: Creates a KDE-application with an empty main widget.
<item>Normal: Creates a KDE-application with session-management, menubar, toolbar, statusbar and support for a document-view codeframe model.
<item>Normal-OpenGL: Creates a KDE-application with session-management, menubar, toolbar, statusbar and support for a document-view
codeframe model. OpenGL(tm) (Mesa3D) support is added.
<item>KDE 2 Normal: Creates a KDE-2 application with session-management, menubar, toolbar, statusbar and support for a document-view codeframe
model.
<item>KDE 2 Mini: Creates a KDE-2 application with an empty main widget.
<item>KDE 2 MDI: Creates a KDE-2 MDI (Multiple Document Interface) application with menubar, toolbar, statusbar and support for a document-view
codeframe model.
</itemize>
<P>
If you wish no dependencies towards the <idx/KDE-libraries/ for end-users, you can choose from four Qt-only types:
<itemize>
<item>Normal: Creates a Qt-Application with a main window containing a menubar, toolbar and statusbar, including support for a generic
document-view model.
<item>QT 2.x SDI: Creates a Qt-2.x Application with a main window containing a menubar, toolbar and statusbar, including support for a single
document-view interface (SDI) model.
<item>QT 2.1 MDI: Creates a Qt-2.1 Application with a main window containing a menubar, toolbar and statusbar, including support for a multiple
document interface (MDI) model.
<item>QextMDI: Creates an MDI framework based on the QextMDI library and Qt2.0x. Allows to switch between both modes, Toplevel and Childframe.
Requires the QextMDI library, see <htmlurl url="http://www.geocities.com/gigafalk/qextmdi.htm"
name="http://www.geocities.com/gigafalk/qextmdi.htm"> for more information.
</itemize>

Mind that the Qt 2 normal and Qt 2 MDI template make use of the KDE autoconf/automake system. This
enables you to convert your existing Qt-only application into a KDE application easily as the
automatic checks for needed KDE libraries and header files can be added with little change on the
project; see section <ref id="Project Hacking" name="Project Hacking"> for more information.

These two Qt templates also enable you to internationalize the GUI of your application by
integrating Qt Linguist. The way to handle KDevelop for adding languages is identical to KDE
projects.

Further, the Application Wizard offers a template for creating GNOME-compliant
applications with the GTK+ C-library with a ready-to-run mainwindow containing a menubar, toolbar
and statusbar.
The two C and C++ -Application types offer a framework for creating commandline applications.

And last but not least you can create an empty projekt, e.g. to work with existing projects.

The wizard asks for your project name, version and the location where the project directory will be build.  Further, your Name and
Email address are asked for inserting them in header and cpp templates on top of your source files as well as for entries in the
*.lsm file.

For adding revision control to your project, see <ref id="CVS Integration" name="CVS Integration">.

<sect>Opening and Closing of Projects
<p>
KDevelop is by default configured to open the last project loaded when starting. This allows a fast start, but you may want to
change that to just start the IDE without any project. To prevent the default behavior, disable the "Load last project" option in
the <ref id="KDevelop Setup" name="KDevelop Setup"> dialog.

To open another project, select "Open" from the "Project" menu or press the "Open Project" button on the toolbar. In case you've
got another project currently open, this will be closed. If your current project then contains files that aren't saved, you are
asked to save all changed files. Thereby, you can select which file to save and which you want to close without saving, or to save
all at once.

Then you get an "Open Project" dialog, where you can change to the directory containing the project file to be loaded. KDevelop
<idx/project files/ have the <em/*.kdevprj/ mime-type which is also displayed by a project icon. Select the project file and press
"Open". When loading a project, the Class Browser scans all files and builds the initial classtree, so you can start working on the
project by using the Class Browser directly.

Another comfortable way to open a project is to select the project file in the KFM, the <idx/KDE/ File Manager. This will start
KDevelop with loading the selected project file. You could as well open a project by commandline, entering <tt/kdevelop
projectname.kdevprj/.

When closing KDevelop, your project file will be saved automatically and the IDE detects if you have changed any project files.
Then you will be asked to save any changes before exiting. The available options for closing are the same than for closing a
project before loading another.

<sect>Editing a Project
<p>
After you created a new project with the <idx/KAppWizard/, the usual task is to extend the project by editing the already created
sources and adding <idx/classes/, <idx/pixmaps/, pictures and whatelse you project needs. Now, editing a project means that you can change the
default project after its generation by menus and dialogs according to your needs. The next section therefore describes how you
can add existing files and <idx/classes/ as well as creating new files. This is needed for building your project, but this won't help
you for the installation process by the end-user. Therefore, section <ref id="Setting Project File Options" name="Setting Project File
Options"> describes how to set File Properties especially for additional files that you want make to install, like documentation or
<idx/pixmaps/.
Another part in project maintaining is adding translations for applications that support internationalization, which is described
in <ref id="Adding Translations" name="Adding Translations">.

<ref id="Extending the Project Documentation" name="Extending the Project Documentation"> covers questions on how to create a good set
of documentation for online help enabling the end-user to help himself in case of troubles as well as how to use your product.

Finally, <ref id="Project Hacking" name="Project Hacking"> describes how you can eventually work around the KDevelop project
management in special cases.

<sect1>Adding and Removing Files and Classes<label id="Adding Files and Classes">
<p>
Adding a new file is often used when you think that you should separate your class <idx/implementation/ file into several ones. Then you
need to create an new file which will contain the part of the class <idx/implementation/ you want to move. You can do this by choosing
"New" from the <idx/"File"-menu/, opening the "<idx/New File/" dialog. This enables you to specify the file-type, name and the
location. When entering the filename, KDevelop automatically enters the extension for you, but you can as well change the extensions
towards your own preferences. Further, you can include the header template for sourcefiles, so you don't have to copy this into your
new file yourself. Also, you can decide, if the file is included in the project or not. Mind that this doesn't cover the installation
destination; this has to be configured later by setting the file preferences.

After the new file has been created, the project file will be updated as well as the according <idx/Makefile.am/'s.
To add a complete class to your project, you can construct a new class with the Classgenerator which is invoked by "<idx/New Class/" from
the Project-menu.

In case you have an existing project and you want to add certain <idx/classes/ that you want to
re-use in your project, select "Add File(s) to Project..." from the <idx/"Project"-menu/. Select
"Add existing files", which will open a dialog to let you specify which files will be added to the
project and the destination directory. Mind that the files will be copied into the specified
directory and added to the project. You should call "Make" after adding sources; then your added
files will be included in the build-process. In case you want to add e.g. <idx/pixmaps/ that have to
be installed by the end-user, you should update the File Properties for the added file and specify
the installation path (see <ref id="Setting Project File Options" name="Setting Project File
Options">).



To add a file to the project that is already in the project directory, go to the <idx/RFV/, where all project-included files are
displayed by their project status by a red ! over the file icon. Select the file you want to add to the project (which has a normal
file icon) and press the right mouse button to get the popup-menu. Then select "Add".

Files can also be removed from your project. This could be needed in cases where you don't want to use pre-generated files that
are already given by the <idx/KAppWizard/. To remove a file, you have additionally the option between removing a file from the project
or delete it completely. To remove a file from the project, select the file in the <idx/LFV/ or the <idx/RFV/, press the right mouse button
and select "remove". To delete a file, select "delete physically".

<sect1>Setting Project File Options<label id="Setting Project File Options">
<p>
The file properties dialog can be accessed via the project menu or within the <idx/LFV/ by a right mouseclick.  It shows the project
files in groups as they are sorted in the <idx/LFV/ and displays the file properties like file size, file type and if the file is
included in the project as well as the installation path if the file is going to be installed by the end-user's make install
command.  It is important for documentation files as well as <idx/pixmaps/ to specify the location where the files should go when the
project is build and installed by end users, so you have to set up those locations. For standard <idx/KDE/ location macros you should
look in your <idx/Makefile.am/ where the location macros are specified.


<sect1>Adding Translations<label id="Adding Translations">
<p>
As <idx/KDE/ allows configuring your desktop and the behavior of your applications, you also have the option to choose the language
that your application uses, in regards of the use of online-documentation as well as the application's look. For documentation files,
this seems a trivial task. You would add a subdirectory labeled by the desired language, e.g. <tt/de/ for German, to the
<tt/docs/ directory of your project and copy the english documentation into that directory. Then you would generate the
documentation and set all project file options for the installation directories. Then you could start translating the <idx/SGML/ file to
your desired language and regenerate the documentation; then you're done.
For the application, this seems a bit more difficult for the programmer. Now, we want to explain how to enable
internationalization support for your application and how to add the languages you want to support.

First, you have to enclose all visible strings of your application that appear in bars or dialogs with the <tt/<idx/i18n/()/ macro.
This macro is a replacement for the function <tt/klocale->translate()/ of the KLocale class and much easier to use. As this macro
is declared in the <tt/kapp.h/ include file, you have to add <tt/#include &lt;kapp.h&gt;/ to the source file or the class
<idx/declaration/ file of the class that makes use of the macro. Also it should be mentioned, that although <tt/<idx/i18n/()/ is a macro and
therefore you could think about using the original function, this won't work because the strings that are set up for translation
have to be read out of the sources and get stored in the application's translation file (&lt;YourApp&gt;.pot in the /po
subdirectory). This task is done by the program xgettext, and to do this, you would enter <tt/make <idx/messages// in your project
directory containing the sources. As xgettext depends on the <tt/<idx/i18n/()/ macro, the original function won't do the job.

For translations themselves, you first have to create the message file containing all strings that are used in your sources with
the <tt/<idx/i18n/()/ macro. This can be done by choosing "Make <idx/messages/ and merge" from the Build-menu.
Then you have to add the languages that your application wants to support. Therefore, select "Add Translation File" from the
Project-menu. This opens a language selection dialog. Select the language and press OK. This will build the ASCII file containing
entries for the filename of the string and the line where the original string is placed. Then you will see a <tt/msgid/ line
containing the string to translate, followed by <tt/msgstr/. The msgstr line is mostly empty except for the translations already
provided by the <idx/KDE-libraries/. Those have to be filled with the according translations of your language.

You could think about writing the translations by hand, which can also be done. But the <idx/KDE-SDK/ offers the use of the program
<idx/KTranslator/, which ready the already existing files from other applications installed on the system, so you can reuse already
translated strings to support your language.

To access <idx/KTranslator/, the easiest way is selecting a &lt;language&gt;.po file in the /po directory either in the <idx/LFV/ or in the
<idx/RFV/. This opens <idx/KTranslator/ and lets you do the translating easily. Mind that you have to set up <idx/KTranslator/'s properties
yourself to include the author name and the language as well as the destination file. <idx/KTranslator/ by default only opens your
translation file.

For all translation files, <tt/<idx/make// uses the program <tt/msgfmt/ to format your message files to use with the binary, but you
don't have to take care for that, as well as specifying the destination directory for installing the translation files; this is
all done by KDevelop automatically.

For more information about internationalization support, see <url url="http://www.kde.org">; a lot of people are doing translations for
you to support their language. You will find a list of email-addresses of the translators you could write to and who will help you with
this. Also read <ref id="Using Qt Designer in your Project" name="Using Qt Designer in your Project"> and
<htmlurl url="programming/index-11.html" name="The KDevelop Programming Handbook"> where questions
about internationalization are covered again.

<sect2>Internationalization of KDE 2.0 Applications
<p>
KDE 2.0 projects have a slightly different handling of adding po files and keeping them up-to-date
than KDE 1.x projects.

The first thing to watch out is that when generating a new KDE 2.0 project, make package-messages is
called from the base directory of your project in opposition to make messages in the project큦
subdirectory in KDE 1.x applications. While merging strings is done with calling make merge in the
po directory in KDE 1, this is called automatically <tt>within</tt> make package-messages -
resulting in an error message even while creating your project with the application wizard.

Another issue to watch out is that KDevelop installs a script called <bf>extractrc</bf> into your
$KDEDIR/bin directory. This script is originally located in the KDE CVS module kdesdk/scripts and is
called automatically within make package-messages, if your Makefile.am contains the line
<tt>messages:rc.cpp</tt> instead of <tt>messages:</tt>. This is the default for the KDE 2 normal and
KDE 2 MDI project type, the KDE 2 mini only uses <tt>messages:</tt>.

What it does actually is extracting the strings out of your XML resource file to build the
application큦 GUI, which is called &lt;yourapp&gt;ui.rc, and stores these stings in a temporary
rc.cpp file that gets processed while building the pot-file to include these strings into your
internationalization.

However, if you intend to build a KDE 2.0 application based on the KDE 2 mini template, change the
Makefile.am in this section, there are already comments in it what to change where.

<sect2>Internationalization of Qt 2.2.x applications
<p>
Since Qt includes the tr() method together with the QTranslator class in Qt 2.x, you can easily
internationalize your Qt-only project as well. KDevelop 1.4 supports this by using the tools that
come with Qt큦 Linguist: lupdate and lrelease. The strings used with tr() are read into
language-dependent *.ts files by lupdate; lrelease then converts the translated XML file to a file
*.qm which stores the translations as binary information. You can add each language automatically
within KDevelop, just use the same way as for KDE projects. The *.ts files are stored in the
LFV-Folder "Translations" automatically and Linugist is called when selecting them in the LFV and
the RFV.

<sect1>Extending the Project Documentation<label id="Extending the Project Documentation">
<p>
All projects created with KDevelop contain a pre-configured documentation, which already contains standard chapters for
installation, project name and version as well as the author name and email-address. As KDevelop uses <idx/SGML/-templates, it's very
easy to extend the documentation to a full descriptive helpsystem. The only thing you have to do is editing the <idx/SGML/ file, placed
in docs/en as index.sgml. The reference documentation included with your sgml-tools package can be added to the <idx/Helpbrowser/ and
allow you direct access to special tags as well as a short description of how to extend the documentation. <idx/SGML/ has a lot of
advantages, whereas <idx/KDE/ makes wide use by this documentation type with the additional <idx/KSgml2Html/ tool. This creates the typical
<idx/KDE/-style documentation and makes it look nicer. Anyway, the sgmltools alone are enough to produce a html <idx/output/ that is already
included in your application. To create the documents using <idx/KSgml2Html/, install the tool and run "Make User-Manual" from the
Build-menu. The Documentation Browser allows a direct controlling of the <idx/output/ by selecting "Project User-Manual" from the
Help-menu or the according icon in the <idx/DOC/-tree. Then you can browse the documentation online in KDevelop and have a better
overview by the <idx/output/ over <idx/errors/ that result in missing tags.

Now, while extending the documentation, you can't avoid that additional files are produced that have to be included into the
project as each <tt/sect/-tag creates a new <idx/HTML/ file. The <idx/output/ generated by the <idx/KAppWizard/ is already included in the project,
so you don't have to care for their installation path. What you have to watch out for is any index-xx.html file, where xx is
higher than 6 (as the first six pages are already included in the project). After generating the documentation, switch to the <idx/RFV/
and browse to your documentation directory. Press the right mouse button over the files to add and select "Add". Further,
<idx/KSgml2Html/ adds the <idx/KDE/ logo to the documentation directory. This file, <tt/logotp3.gif/, has to be added to the project as well.
Then you have to select the "File Properties" either from the Project menu or by the popup menu in the file-viewers. The easiest
way to set the installation path is to select a documentation file already set up for installation such as <tt/index.html/. You
see that <tt/Install/ is checked and the Installdir+filename already contains the destination. Mark the Installdir and enter
CTRL+C to copy the installation path to the clipboard. Then select the file you want to specify for installation. Enable
<tt/Install/, this will enable the installdir-entry field, already containing the filename. Place the cursor in front of the
filename and enter CTRL+V to insert the clipboard contents (which was the installation path copied before). This is the fastest
way to specify the installation path. For more options about specifying installation destinations, see <htmlurl
url="programming/index-14.html" name="The KDevelop Programming Handbook">.

<sect>Project Hacking<label id="Project Hacking">
<p>
When working with a project, you should never edit the project file by hand. This will prevent KDevelop from loading your project
correctly under certain circumstances, as well as changes will not result in updating the <idx/Makefile/s. To change any settings for
your project, you have to use the given menu entries like e.g. for adding files or setting file properties. For experts that are
not comfortable with certain options for e.g. the <idx/Linker/ or need additional project configuration, you should work yourself into
the <idx/Makefile.am/ macros and add all changes in the <idx/Makefile.am/'s after the section separated with the entry "KDevelop write area".
As the GNU-tools are using the commands at the end of all macro files, you can overwrite KDevelop's settings with this. Mind that
this will prevent using KDevelop for any changes related to project configuration.

<sect1>Project Type Definitions
<p>
KDevelops project files stores the project information in the style of readable KDE config files.
You can find the according sections therefore easily you큥e looking for. Now, to convert an existing
project to another project typ can shorten the time to port an existing KDE 1.x project over to KDE
2 (which counts as well for Qt). Just change the following section with the according project tpe:

<tscreen><verb>
[General]
author=Ralf Nolden
project_type=normal_kde2
</verb></tscreen>

Valid project tpes are:
<itemize>
<item><tt>normal_empty</tt>: Custom Project
<item><tt>normal_kde</tt>: KDE 1.x Normal (SDI) Project
<item><tt>mini_kde</tt>: KDE 1.x Mini Project
<item><tt>normalogl_kde</tt>: KDE 1.x OpenGL Project
<item><tt>normal_kde2</tt>: KDE 2.0 Normal (SDI) Project
<item><tt>mini_kde2</tt>: KDE 2.0 Mini Project
<item><tt>mdi_kde2</tt>: KDE 2.0 MDI Project
<item><tt>normal_qt</tt>: Qt-1.44 Project (SDI)
<item><tt>normal_qt2</tt>: Qt-2.2.x Project (SDI)
<item><tt>mdi_qt2</tt>: Qt-2.2.x Project (MDI, uses QWorkspace)
<item><tt>mdi_qextmdi</tt>: Qt-2.x Project (uses the QextMDI library)
</itemize>

<sect1>Qt Designer <p>
Another hint may be of good use when developing KDE 2.0/ Qt 2.2.x applications
using the Qt Designer to create user interfaces. The ui files get added by KDevelop to the _SOURCES
line in the Makefile.am of the subdirectory containing the ui file. This may result in the scenario
that you want to include the header file of the generated dialog which may not exist yet when your
file that includes it gets compiled as the <bf>uic</bf> (Qt user interface compiler) generates the
C++ output. However, the am_edit file will resolve all dependencies for you, so you don큧 have to
worry about that.

<sect1>Converting *.kdevdlg files
<p>
KDevelop 1.4 comes with a converter script <tt>kdevdlg2ui</tt> to turn already constructed dialogs
with it큦 internal dialogeditor into a *.ui file. However, you should be aware that you may have
to re-inherit from your class that is generated by Qt큦 uic and add your implementations from your
former KDevelop dialog there. The converter script is mainly used to convert the dialogs user
interface, not your methods, signals or slots. So, re-editing the converted *.ui file may be
necessary as well as inheriting from it큦 generated class. Existing KDE 1.x applications can큧 make
use of *.ui files, therefore generate a new framework for your KDE 2/Qt2 application and move over
your implemtation, *.kdevprj and Makefile.am큦 of your subdirectories.


<sect>Compiler and <idx/Linker/ Flags for Projects
<p>
Each new project contains all needed options for the <idx/Compiler/ and <idx/Linker/ as well as
general settings. By default, your project is set to use <idx/debugging/ by the -g flag, and
<idx/warnings/ are set to the standard, -Wall. This ensures you can debug your application and
detect constructions that may cause program <idx/errors/. For some applications, you would need
additional <idx/Compiler/ or <idx/Linker/ flags, especially if you're using libraries that are not
currently included by the <idx/Linker/. Then you need to update the project by configuring the
correct settings with the Project Options dialog. See <ref id="Build Settings" name="Build
Settings"> for more information how and where to set Compiler Options, Warnings and <idx/Linker/
Options.

<sect>External Projects
<p>
Existing automake/autoconf compatible projects (which make use of Makefile.am큦 to store their
information) can be used together with KDevelop by creating a KDevelop project file with the
<bf>kimport</bf> script. After the project file has been build up, you should edit it with your
favorite editor and set the project type accoding to your needs, see <ref id="Project Hacking"
name="Project Hacking"> for more details about available project types.
Mind that you should deselect "modify Makefiles" in the Project Options after you loaded your
project the first time.


<chapt>Build Settings<label id="Build Settings">
<p>
The Project Options dialog, accessed by the project menu, lets you specify all needed parameters for your project. Those will be
used for the <idx/Makefile.am/'s and the <idx/configure/.in script (e.g. version number change or <idx/compiler warnings/ ) and thereby set the
compilation preferences as well.. After changing the project options, you should invoke "<idx/make/ clean" or "rebuild all" to compile
your project with the new options. Please mind that <idx/debugging/ is only available if the project options are set to create <idx/debugging/
information, the amount can be set with the debug level (0-3). If you add functions that belong to a library that is not included
in the <idx/Linker/ flags, your program will not link correctly if those are not updated, so keep track of your library linking.

For a release build of your application or for distributing the sourcecode package, you should watch the following standard
settings:

<itemize>
<item>disable <idx/debugging/
<item>enable optimization and set optimization level to <bf/-02/
<item>set the <idx/compiler warnings/ to <bf/-Wall/
<item>for each new release, increase the version number and update the project.lsm file for version and requirements.
</itemize>

<sect>General Options
<p>
The first page of the Project Options dialog sets the general options for your project. These are project name and number, the
handbook sgml file which is used for generating a set of <idx/HTML/ files that are included in the project and specific information
about the author. The short description field is for additional information that you want to include like the program's purpose
and the like.

<sect>Compiler Options<label id="Compiler Options">
<p>
The <idx/compiler options/ page sets the compiler flags towards your target, <idx/debugging/ and additional.

<sect1>Target
<p>
The target box contains two options that can be set:

Target Machine: You have the choice to set the target machine option here by choosing between your machine (default) and i386v,
which is the option if you <idx/configure/d your <idx/Compiler/ as a cross-compiler for an Intel 386-compatible machine running System V. This
option sets the -b flag to the <idx/Compiler/. Usually you would leave this to the default.

Optimize: You can enable optimization for your build process by this option, meaning to set the -O flag. If not checked, the flag
is set to -O0, so no optimization will be used. If you enable optimization by checking this option, you can as well specify the
optimization level below from 1 to 3.

For a release version of your application, enable optimization and set the level to 2.

<sect1>Debugging
<p>
Right of the Target box, you can see the <idx/debugging/-section. This means that you can set your <idx/Compiler/ to include information for
debuggers within the final binary, so the programmer can follow the execution of the application with the debugger in direct
context to the sourcecode.

Enable <idx/debugging/ therefore sets the -g flag; the <idx/debugging/ level specifies the amount of information to be included in the binary.
Available are level 1 to 3 to choose from. Mind that the binary execution will be slower by setting any <idx/debugging/ option and that
the binary size will increase by the <idx/debugging/ level.

Generate extra information for gprof: sets the -pg flag, resulting that the <idx/Compiler/ will include information for the gprof
program that displays caller graphs of your program's function.

Store temporary intermediate files: sets the -save-temps flag. This will result in storing the usually temporary files produced by
the preprocessor and the assembler. A compilation of a sourcefile will therefore produce three <idx/output/ files: an *.o file which is
the final <idx/output/ of the <idx/Compiler/, an *.i file produced by the preprocessor and an *.s file as the <idx/output/ of the assembler.

For a release of your project, disable any <idx/debugging/.

<sect1>Additional Options
<p>
The text entry field on the bottom is intended for you to manually set any flags for the <idx/Compiler/ by setting the CXXFLAGS
environment <idx/variable/ in the <idx/Makefile/s, so make sets the flags before the build process and reset them afterwards. For a complete
description of all available <idx/Compiler/ flags you should see your <idx/Compiler/ documentation; for gcc and egcs this can be done by
<bf/man gcc/; <bf/man g++/ will show you information about the c++ script that is used to lead the <idx/Compiler/.


<sect>Compiler Warnings<label id="Compiler Warnings">
<p>
The following gives a description about the <idx/Compiler/ warning options that can be set on page 3 of the project options dialog. The
explanations are taken from the man page for GCC, egcs version 1.1.1.
The <idx/warnings/ themselves are diagnostic messages that indicate that constructions may cause <idx/errors/.

<descrip>
<tag/-Wall/Standard `-W' options combined.
<p>
<tag/-W/ Compile with -W. This option sets options not included in -Wall which are very specific. Please read GCC-Info for more
information.
<p>
<tag/-Wtraditional/Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and ANSI C.
<p>
<tag/-Wundef/Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an `#if' directive.
<p>
<tag/-Wshadow/Warn whenever a local <idx/variable/ shadows another local <idx/variable/.
<p>
<tag/-Wid-clash-LEN/Warn whenever two distinct identifiers match in the first len characters. This may help you prepare a program
that will compile with certain obsolete, brain-damaged <idx/Compiler/s.
<p>
<tag/-Wlarger-then-LEN/Warn whenever an object of larger than LEN bytes is defined.
<p>
<tag/-Wpointer-arith/Warn about anything that depends on the 쳒ize of a function type or of void. GNU C assigns these types a
size of 1, for convenience in calculations with void * pointers and pointers to functions.
<p>
<tag/-Wbad-function-cast/Warn whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching type. For example, warn if <tt/int malloc()/ is
cast to <tt/anything *./
<p>
<tag/-Wcast-equal/Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from the target type. For example, warn if a
const char * is cast to an ordinary char *.
<p>
<tag/-Wcast-align/Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the target is increased. For example, warn
if a char * is cast to an int * on machines where integers can only be accessed at two- or four-byte boundaries.
<p>
<tag/-Wwrite-strings/Give string constants the type const char[length] so that copying the address of one into a non-const char *
pointer will get a warning. These <idx/warnings/ will help you find at compile time code that can try to write into a string constant,
but only if you have been very careful about using const in <idx/declaration/s and prototypes. Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance;
this is why we did not make `-Wall' request these <idx/warnings/.
<p>
<tag/-Wconversion/Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what would happen to the same argument in the absence of a
prototype. This includes conversions of fixed point to floating and vice versa, and conversions changing the width or signedness
of a fixed point argument except when the same as the default promotion.
<p>
<tag/-Wsign-compare/Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce an incorrect result when the signed
value is converted to unsigned.
<p>
<tag/-Waggregate-return/Warn if any functions that return
structures or unions are defined or called. (In languages where you can return an array, this also elicits a warning.)
<p>
<tag/-Wmissing-prototypes/ Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype <idx/declaration/. This warning is issued even if the definition
itself provides a prototype. The aim is to detect global functions that fail to be declared in header files.
<p>
<tag/-Wmissing-<idx/declaration/s/ Warn if a global function is defined without a previous <idx/declaration/. Do so even if the definition
itself provides a prototype. Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in header files. -Wredundant-decls
Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in cases where multiple <idx/declaration/ is valid and changes nothing.
<p>
<tag/-Wredundant-decls/Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope even in cases where multiple <idx/declaration/ is
valid and changes nothing.
<p>
<tag/-Wnested-externs/Warn if an extern <idx/declaration/ is encountered within an function.
<p>
<tag/-Winline/Warn if a function can not be inlined, and either it was declared as inline, or else the -fin*line-functions option was given.
<p>
<tag/-Wold-style-cast/Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast is used within a program
<p>
<tag/-Woverloaded-virtual/(C++ only.) In a derived class, the definitions of virtual functions must match the type signature of a
virtual function declared in the base class. Use this option to request <idx/warnings/ when a derived class declares a function that may
be an erroneous attempt to define a virtual function: that is, warn when a function with the same name as a virtual function in
the base class, but with a type signature that doesn't match any virtual functions from the base class.
<p>
<tag/-Wsynth/Warn when g++'s synthesis behavior does not match that of cfront.
<p>
<tag/make all <idx/warnings/ into <idx/errors//(-Werror) Treat <idx/warnings/ as <idx/errors/; abort compilation after any warning.
<p>
</descrip>

For a release of your project, it is recommended to enable <bf/-Wall/.

<sect><idx/Linker/ Options<label id="Linker Options">
<p><nidx/linker options/
The <idx/Linker/ Options for your current project can be set by the last page of the project options dialog. You have to enable those
libraries that your application uses to link them to your binary with the <idx/Linker/, e.g. your application uses the class
<cdx/KFileDialog/. As the class <cdx/KFileDialog/ is part of the KFile library, you have to enable kfile. For <idx/classes/
or functions that are not listed as checkboxes, use the <bf/"additional libraries"/ field.

<sect1><idx/Linker/ Flags
<p><nidx/linker flags/
<descrip>
<tag/remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable:/ This means that all redundant information will be
removed from the object files and the binary, resulting that <idx/debugging/ will not be possible. For as long as your application is in
a development stage and not released as final, you should leave this option disabled.

<tag/prevent using shared libraries:/ This option disables the use of shared libraries on systems that support this. On systems
using no shared libraries, this option will have no effect.

<tag/additional flags:/ Here, you can enter additional flags for the <idx/Linker/, setting the LDFLAGS environment <idx/variable/ by <idx/make/. The
available options can be taken from the man page for <bf/ld/ or your <idx/Compiler/ manpage.
</descrip>

<sect1>Libraries
<p>
The libraries section contains checkboxes for the most needed libraries in conjuction with Qt/<idx/KDE/ application
development. You have to enable those libraries that your application uses, otherwise the <idx/Linker/ will complain about unresolved
symbol tables.
<descrip>
<tag/<cdx/X11// The X11 library. Recommended for all X-Window programs.
<p>
<tag/<cdx/Xext// The X11 extension library. Also most X-Window programs depend on Xext.
<p>
<tag/<cdx/qt// The <idx/Qt-library/. Recommended for Qt and <idx/KDE/ applications.
<p>
<tag/<cdx/kdecore// The KDE Core library; contains the <idx/classes/ for KDE Application frameworks.
<p>
<tag/<cdx/kdeui// The KDE User Interface library; contains KDE-specific <idx/widgets/.
<p>
<tag/<cdx/khtmlw// The KHTML Widget library.
<p>
<tag/<cdx/kfm// The KFM library containing <idx/classes/ for KFM functions.
<p>
<tag/<cdx/kfile// The KFile library. Contains file dialogs etc.
<p>
<tag/<cdx/kspell// The KSpell library. Contains an interface for programs to use Ispell for spell-checking.
<p>
<tag/<cdx/kab// The KAdressBook library. Needed for access to the addressbook as well as providing addressbook <idx/widgets/
<p>
</descrip>
<bf/additional libraries:/ Here you can enter additional libraries that your application needs, e.g. the KOM library. Set the
libraries with the -l option; for the example -lkom.

<sect><idx/Make/ Options<label id="Make Options">
<p>
As GNU <idx/make/ supports some useful options, the Project Options dialog contains a page called "Make-Options", where those can be
en/disabled. The available settings are:

<descrip>
<tag/Print debug information/ prints out all information about the <idx/project files/ and what <idx/make/ determines for rebuilding them.
<p>
<tag/Continue after <idx/errors// tries to continue with the compilation after an error occurred (e.g. a file couldn't be compiled due to an
error)
<p>
<tag/Print the data base/ prints out the <idx/make/-database for the current process which contains the changes from the last
build-run.
<p>
<tag/Environment variables/ give the current environment variables a higher priority than the currently used variables in
the <idx/Makefile/s.
<p>
<tag/No built-in rules/ doesn't use built-in rules for <idx/make/.
<p>
<tag/Touch files/ don't run the <idx/Compiler/ on changed files; instead only touches them. This sets them as already processed by <idx/make/.
<p>
<tag/Ignore all <idx/errors// Ignores all <idx/errors/ that occur
<p>
<tag/Silent operation/ doesn't print out any information about the build-process
<p>
<tag/Print working directory/ prints the current directory during the <idx/make/-process.
<p>
<tag/job number/ sets the amount of parallel processes for <idx/make/. For a single-CPU system we recommend setting this to one or two.
<p>
<tag/set modified/ sets the selected file modified. Choose the file by clicking the folder button on the right. Setting a file modified
means that the file will be processed by <idx/make/ and compiled if it is a source file.
<p>
<tag/additional options/ set additional options to <idx/make/; those can be found in your local man page for "GNU Make".
<p>
<tag/Rebuild behaviour on run/ Sets the actions taken when you choose run. There are three options you can choose from:
<itemize>
<item>always rebuild: Always rebuild without checking for modified files.
<item>Warning on modification: Warn if source files have been modified and ask if the project should be rebuilt.
<item>Only on modification: Check if sources have changed and rebuild if so.
</itemize>
The default is to rebuild always.

</descrip>

<chapt>The Class Browser<label id="The Class Browser">
<p>
<sect>The Classviewer
<p><nidx/classbrowser/
The KDevelop Classviewer is one of the most useful and important tools that the IDE provides a developer for managing his project
sources. When a project is loaded, a class parser reads all project sources for functions, <idx/classes/ etc., then displays the results in
the <idx/CV/ treeview. This chapter shows you how to use the Classviewer and the provided functionality and how it can improve your work.

Classes and their methods can also be accessed by the browser toolbar. There, the left combo selects the class; the right
lets you choose the methods of the selected class. When you select a method, the classbrowser will automatically bring you to the
<idx/implementation/ file and sets the cursor to the method. Finally, the class-assistant button on the right of the method combo will bring
you to the <idx/declaration/ of the method on a click; on another click to the definition. The delayed popup menu, displayed by the
down-arrow on the button, offers additional functionality that is also available in the classviewer's context menus, such as:

<itemize>
<item>Goto Declaration: browses to the <idx/declaration/ of the method
<item>Goto Definition: browses to the definition of the method
<item>Goto Class Declaration: browses to the class <idx/declaration/
<item><idx/New Class/: opens the <idx/New Class/ dialog to construct a new class
<item>Add Method: adds a method to the selected class
<item>Add Attribute: adds an attribute to the selected class
<item>Show graphical classview: Opens the graphical inheritance tree
</itemize>

<sect1>Available Objects
<p>
By available objects, we describe a term that means that C++ code can be seen as a collection of objects- <idx/classes/, their members,
global functions and the like. The classtree displays these objects logically and orders them by character, so they are easy to locate
in the tree as well by their according icon. Therefore the classtree contains a "Classes" and a "Globals" folder. Thereby the "Classes"
folder generally contains the project's <idx/classes/; if your project contains subfolders to manage your sourcefiles, these are also
displayed by their original folder name and contain all <idx/classes/ that are stored in the files located in the subfolder.

Further, when popping up a class, the classtree displays the class contents by separating methods and <idx/attributes/. As these can have
<idx/attributes/ as well like public, private and protected, these are displayed by modified icons as well. You see that a class displayed in
the Class Browser contains all the objects that are present in the class <idx/declaration/.

Now, <idx/classes/ are a very common thing when programming in C++ and will contain most of the code. But applications also contain objects
that have a "Global" appearance to the program. These would be structs, functions etc. Especially the <tt/main()/ function appears in
every application and you need to modify it in one or the other way sometimes. To access these objects, the Classviewer provides the
"Globals" folder, containing subfolders for the following object types:
<itemize>
<item>Structs
<item>Functions
<item>Variables
</itemize>

As the icons displaying these items are similar to those used in the class-viewer, their meaning is easy to guess and to remember by
the programmer.

Finally, it can be stated that the <idx/classviewer/ displays your project graphically by their objects related to their appearance in the
code. In the following section you will learn how to use the <idx/classviewer/ and it's tools in conjunction with your code.

<sect1>Browsing Object Declarations and Implementations
<p>
The Classviewer's best strength is providing a fast and good access to his code by the code's contents independent of the location
within files. Therefore, selections by a mouse click will result in the following actions:

<itemize>
<item><bf/On a classname:/  Switches to the class <idx/declaration/
<item><bf/On a class method:/ Switches to the method <idx/implementation/
<item><bf/On a class attribute:/ Switches to the attribute's <idx/declaration/ in the class <idx/declaration/
<item><bf/On a struct:/ Switches to the struct's <idx/declaration/
<item><bf/On a global function:/ Switches to the function's <idx/implementation/
</itemize>

Now, this provides you the most needed access towards code objects. Apparently, it may be needed to change a method's header, resulting
that you have to change it's <idx/declaration/ in the class as well as the <idx/implementation/. The <idx/classviewer/ supports this by providing
right-button context menus over items. On a method or function, this means that you can select where to go:

<itemize>
<item><bf/Go to definition:/ Switches to the <idx/implementation/- this is the default for a left click as described above
<item><bf/Go to <idx/declaration/:/ Switches to the <idx/declaration/ of the method or function.
</itemize>

By this behavior, the Class Browser offers you access to every place you have to go for coding your C++ application.

The following sections give you a description of the other tools that the Class Browser offers- you will find them very useful when
working with large projects as they enhance working object-orientated on C++ programs.

<sect>The Classtools
<p><nidx/classtools/
The classtools are dialogs that makes it even more easier for the developer to get more information about his project's <idx/classes/.
The <idx/classviewer/ displays all objects by their occurrence in the code, but you sometimes want to get more information about
<idx/classes/ without having to look inside the code. Therefore, the classtool dialogs are specialized on displaying specific class
<idx/attributes/.

The classtool dialog is invoked by the popup menu over a class in the <idx/classviewer/. Select "Classtool", and the dialog will appear.
To get informed about a class, select the class in the combo box on top. Then the buttons in the toolbar provide functions that give
you specific trees for your class. These are:

<descrip>
<tag/ Parents:/
The parents of the selected class, which means the class it inherits. This is useful for multiple inheritance as well as to see why a
class behaves in one or the other way, e.g. for dialogs your parent class could be <tt/<cdx/QWidget// or <tt/<cdx/QDialog//.
<tag/Children:/
Displays the children <idx/classes/ that inherit the current class.
<tag/Clients:/
Classes that make use of the selected class by an attribute in their class <idx/declaration/
<tag/Suppliers:/
The suppliers that give <idx/attributes/ to the selected class.
<tag/Attributes:/ The <idx/attributes/ of the class by their name
<tag/Methods:/ The Methods of the selected class
</descrip>
Further, the selection of the attribute public, protected, private or all shows Attributes, Methods and Virtual Methods by their
attribute value.

<sect>Managing Classes
<p>
The Class Browser additionally allows adding methods and <idx/attributes/ directly by dialogs. This means you don't have to type the
<idx/classdeclaration/ and the <idx/implementation/ header yourself. After adding a method, you only have to set the formal parameters to the
<idx/implementation/ header and, if the method requires an attribute, to the <idx/declaration/.

<bf>&raquo How to add a method to a class</bf>

<enum>
<item>select the class you want to add a method
<item>press the right mouse button; the popup menu appears
<item>select "Add member function".
<item>the "Add member function" dialog appears.
<item>insert the type, <idx/declaration/ and documentation for the method
<item>specify the access and the modifiers for the method
<item>press OK to exit the dialog
</enum>

For adding a <idx/variable/, this is the same action, just with selecting "Add member <idx/variable/" in the popup menu.

The difference between the actions of these dialogs is that the adding of a <idx/variable/ will add the <idx/variable/ to the <idx/classdeclaration/,
the adding of a method will add the method's <idx/declaration/ and the method's <idx/implementation/ header to the sources. As the <idx/classviewer/
directly updates himself, you have a direct access to the new method <idx/implementation/, so you only have to fill out the code for the
actual purpose of the method.

<chapt>Using Qt Designer in your Project<label id="Using Qt Designer in your Project">
<p>
The <idx/Qt Designer/ allows the easy construction of <idx/widgets/ and dialogs your application uses all by graphical means.
You see the direct appearance of your dialog as it will be presented to the user. Using the <idx/Designer/ is usually the first step you
would take after creating a new project with the <idx/KAppWizard/ to create your main view, the user interaction dialogs and, after finishing
the graphical work, the code generation. This way, your project will contain all the usually considered "difficult" parts that normally
would take a long time to implement. Then, the "rest" of your work is implementing the functionality in the generated code. This
chapter deals with how to use the <idx/dialog editor/ to create your project <idx/widgets/ as well as what to do in case you see your <idx/widgets/ need
corrections or additions during the further development process.

You can switch to the <idx/Designer/ either by selecting "Dialog Editor" from the "<idx/View/" menu or by the according toolbar icon.
When you are done, simply close the Designer window.

The following chapters give you an overview of the <idx/Designer's/ interface, how to create a new dialog initially and how set up the
properties of the child <idx/widgets/ that your dialog contains. You also might want to have a look at the
<htmlurl url="http://doc.trolltech.com/designer/book1.html" name="Designer tutorial by Trolltech"> which can also be found offline in
KDevelops documentation browser.

<sect>Create a new dialog with the Designer
<p>
If you want to create a new dialog, simply add a new Designer file.  Go to the menubar and choose File -> New. From the box choose "Qt Designer file"
and enter a name, for example ktestdlg.ui. The .ui file is where the Designer stores the information about the dialog. Now the Designer will come
up and ask you which kind of template you want to use for your class. Let's choose "QDialog" for our example. Now the Designer will present an
empty form called "Form1" and the <idx/Property Editor/. First, we need to give a human-readable name to our dialog, so we click on the form's
background and choose a suitable name for it by changing the "name" property from "Form1" to something suitable. For consistancy reasons
you might want to call the class just like the file it is stored in (or vice versa), so we call it KTestDlg.

In order to get used to the Designer, we recommend reading the  <htmlurl url="http://doc.trolltech.com/designer/book1.html" name="Designer handbook">. It provides
vital information about the usage of the Designer ui and the concepts behind signals and slots handling inside the Designer.


<sect1>Excursion: How ui files become source
<p>
The Designer stores the dialog class in a XML-compatible format. So, how do we get a C++ file out ouf the Designer file? Answer: KDevelop takes
care of this! It adds the .ui file to the makefile which will then ensure that a header- and a source file will be created at compiletime. So you can
just use it without really taking care of the source.

Because the files are recreated on every compile, you cannot implement your stuff directly into the generated files but have to derive from it.
Read the next chapter to learn how this works.


<sect>Using your new dialog inside KDevelop
<p>
Next, we create a class inside KDevelop that will derive from the class created with the Designer. From the "Project" menu, choose "New Class".
Enter "KTest" as classname. We we derive from KTestDlg, enter "KTestDlg" in "Baseclass". As QDialog (the baseclass for our Dialog) derives
from QWidget, you also need to enable the "generate a QWiget-Childclass" checkbox. This are all information KDevelop requires. If you choose
"OK", KDevelop will create two files called "ktest.cpp" and "ktest.h" which hold the "KTest" class that derives from "KTestDlg". Note that the
"#include" statement for "ktestdlg.h" has already been inserted by KDevelop. Now you can simply implement all your functions and use the class
inside your project.

<sect>Dialing with virtual slots
<p>
If you want to reimplement virtual slots, use the RMB Menu in the classbrower and choose "Add slot" or use the classwizzard button situated on the
right of method combobox in KDevelops toolbar.

Note: Do NOT call the underlying virtual function (e.g. KTestDlg::slotCancel()) in the overriding method!

<chapt>The Internal Debugger<label id="The Internal Debugger">
<sect>Setup
<p>

The default setup for KDevelop is to use the internal debugger. You can change this under Options select the "KDevelop setup" menu
item, and then the Debugger tab.

Click on "Use external debugger" if you wish to use a different debugger and enter the name of the debugger to use. See your
debuggers documentation on how to run it.

Selecting the internal debugger enables an additional set of options you can choose from:
<p>
<itemize>
<item>Display static members: Displaying static members makes gdb slower in producing data within kde and qt. It may change
the "signature" of the data which QString and friends rely on. But if you need to debug into these values then check this option.
<item>Display mangled names: When displaying the disassembled code you can select to see the methods mangled names.
However, non-mangled names are easier to read.
<item>Try setting BPs on lib load: This will try to set pending breakpoints on loading a library. If GDB hasn't seen a library that will be
loaded via "dlopen" then it will refuse to set a breakpoint in that code. We can get gdb to stop on a library load and hence try to set
the pending breakpoints. See <ref id="Shared libraries and breakpoints" name="Shared libraries and breakpoints"> for more details
and a "gotcha" relating to this behaviour. If you are not "dlopen"ing libs, leave this off.
<item>Enable floating toolbar: This will allow you to use the floating toolbar to control the debugger in addition to the menu and buttons.
The toolbar is most useful for debugging GUI applications. For details see <ref id="The floating toolbar" name="The floating toolbar">.
<item>Enable separate terminal for application i/o: This allows you to enter terminal input when your application contains
terminal input code (eg cin, fgets etc.). If you use terminal input in your app, then tick this option. Otherwise leave this off.
<bf>Tip:</bf> This option is most useful, if you use it in combination with <ref id="The floating toolbar" name="the floating
toolbar">, because this way, the terminal window won't be hidden behind the KDevelop window when you control the debugger.
</itemize>
<p>

<sect>Using the internal debugger
<p>
<sect1>Changes made in the tree and output view window
<p>
If you choose the internal debugger, four tabs are added to your tree and output view windows.
<sect2>On the tree view window
<p>
<itemize>
<item>VAR tab : A tree view of the local variables at the current place in the  program you have stopped at. You can also see local
variables in the function  that called this functions. The VAR tab also contains a watch window. This allows  you to see the value of
global variables, or perhaps you may want to see only  one local variable rather than the variable in a large list of
local variables.
</itemize>

<sect2>On the output view window
<p>
<itemize>
<item>breakpoint : A list of breakpoints set and their current state.
<item>framestack : The calling stack.
<item>disassemble : A machine instruction view of the code showing the current instruction to be executed.
</itemize>
<p>

<sect1>Changes made in the Debug menu and on the panel
<p>
<sect2>On the panel
<p>
Two normal and two dropdown buttons to control the debugger functions will be accessible as soon as you start the debugger.
<p>
<sect2>In the Debug menu
<p>
When you start debugging, ten items to control the debugger will be enabled.
<p>
Available functions: <label id="Available functions">

<sect1>Details
<p>

<sect2>Breakpoints
<p>
Breakpoints can be set against source lines in a file (referred to as breakpoints) or on variables in the source (referred to as watchpoints). 
Both types of breakpoints can be set at anytime, however watchpoints on local variables only have meaning  in the variables local 
scope. Watchpoints have more meaning when you are dealing with global variables.

<sect2>Set/Unset breakpoints
<p>
Simple one click set/unset. Click on the "icon" border to the left of the text in the editor at the line you want the breakpoint. Click again 
on this line to unset the breakpoint.

<sect2>Alternative beakpoint manipulating via menus
<p>
By right clicking on a breakpoint in the breakpoint list or on a breakpoint  in the editors icon border you will get a menu of breakpoint 
options. This allows you to remove this breakpoint, clear all breakpoints, or edit the breakpoint.

<sect2>Editing breakpoints
<p>
Use the above menu to display the edit breakpoint dialog. This contains the following fields :
<enum>
<item>Conditional: Enter the condition that must be met before gdb will interrupt the program execution.
<item>Ignore count: How many times you want the code to past through this breakpoint before gdb interrupts the program execution.
<item>Enable: When enabled gdb will break at this breakpoint. When disabled gdb will not break here.
</enum>

<sect2>Clear all breakpoints
<p>
Removes all the breakpoints for this program.

<sect2>Set/Unset watchpoints
<p>
In the VAR view click with the Right Mouse button on a variable. A popup menu will be displayed allowing you to set a watchpoint on 
the local variable. This functionality is limited to the scope that the local variable is in. As the variable goes out of scope the program 
breaks and the watchpoint is deleted.

WARNING: This is known to be problematic, so use caution when setting watchpoints on local variables.

The watchpoint can also be set by a right mouse click on a previously entered watch variable, and selecting "toggle watchpoint"

<sect2>Set/Unset Watch variables
<p>
At the bottom of the VAR view there is the "Watch" field where you can enter the variable name you wish to see display in the watch 
list. Enter the variable name and type "enter" or click on the "Add" button alongside the field. Right Mouse clicking on the watch 
variable in the treeview will bring up a menu so that you can remove the variable from the list.

You can also enter a watch variable by right mouse clicking on a variable name in the editor window. This displays a popup menu 
with "watch: variable name" on it.

<sect2>Changing variable values
<p>
This is done via the watch variable. If you have a variable "test" then to set "test" to 5 type "test=5" in the watch field and add it to the 
list. Note that "test" will be set to "5" EVERY time the program stops at a breakpoint, so once you have set the variable, usually you 
should remove the item from the watch view.

<sect>The floating toolbar <label id="The floating toolbar">
<p>
The floating toolbar is a feature of the internal debugger, which greatly improves your comfort in debugging GUI applications. 
The toolbar is either on top of all windows displayed, or docked into the panel. When docked you can run your code by clicking on the 
docked icon. The function this performs is the "step over" function. Right clicking on the docked item allows you to restore the toolbar 
and optionally place focus on kdevelop.

Besides the <ref id="Available functions" name="functions available from the Debug Menu">, the floating toolbar offers two additional 
functions:
<itemize>
<item>Set focus on kdevelop : Set the focus on kdevelop
<item>Set focus on app : This sets the focus on the window that had focus
 when you pressed the "set focus on kdevelop" button. This is a
 compromise, it should set the focus on the application being debugged but this
 is difficult to do. If anyone has a better solution than the current functionality
 then please let us know.
</itemize>

When gdb interrupts the program, probably because a breakpoint has been triggered, we highlight the "Set focus on kdevelop". We do 
not automatically switch focus to kdevelop so that you can view the application window at this point. Click on the "set focus" button to 
switch to kdevelop or press a button on the toolbar to perform your selected function.

<sect> Shared libraries and breakpoints <label id="Shared libraries and breakpoints">
<p>
Shared libraries and breakpoints have a problem that has a reasonable solution. The problem is that gdb will not accept breakpoints in 
source that is in a shared library which has not yet been opened but will be opened via a dlopen.

The solution is to get gdb to tell us when a shared library has been opened. We do so by setting "stop-on 1". This means that when the 
user sets a breakpoint, we flag this breakpoint as pending, try to set the breakpoint and if gdb says it succeeded then flag it as active. If 
gdb is not successful then we leave the breakpoint as pending. The next instruction will always be "continue" .

This is known as "lazy breakpoints"

However, this can lead to a problem when you use the "step over" command and step over code that will load a library. This will trigger a 
break on the library load, and, normally the debugger would do a "continue" (ie run to the next breakpoint or the end of the code). The user, 
however, is expecting the program to stop at the next line, so in this situation we do not continue, but leave it at that point (which will be somewhere 
inside a dlopen command). This is disconcerting but cannot be helped.

<chapt>CVS Integration<label id="CVS Integration">
<p>

KDevelop also takes care of managing your project via CVS repositories. The goal behind CVS (concurrent 
version control) is to enable groups of developers to work on the same source-tree independently and to merge 
changes into the repository. Usually, the repository is located at a server. The initial repository contains
the base set of files that the project includes; directories and files are then added or removed to the CVS by 
the developers. Locally, the developer works on his copy of the CVS tree. He writes his changes into his files 
and tests, if his project still works, at least to a certain extend where incomplete sources don't prevent 
other developers from still working on the CVS repository if they receive the changes. 

<sect>Creating a Repository
<p>
When creating a new project with KDevelop, you can directly import the project as a CVS module. To enable 
this, you have to have CVS installed (which should be already, if not, revise your system installation or
contact your system administrator).

On the third page of the KAppWizard (VCS support), choose "CVS". Then the editing fields of this page get 
active and you can specify the import parameters, see below for the given options. The KAppWizard will then 
import the project source tree as a module into the CVS root directory and create your new project as a local 
copy of the CVS source tree that you will be working on.

<bf>Attention:</bf> to create an initial repository, you have to have write  access to the CVS root directory 
! Also the CVS root directory has to be on the same machine where you큥e running KDevelop ! If you want to 
have the repository on a dedicated CVS server either contact this servers system administrator to create the 
project with KDevelop on the server machine or do the following steps: 

<itemize>
<item>create your project locally
<item>import the project source tree as a module on the CVS server
<item>delete local project source tree
<item>check out the project source tree from CVS 
<item>enable CVS support in the project options dialog as described below after loading the project file of 
your CVS copy you checked out.
</itemize>   

For more details on CVS commands, please revise your system help on cvs, e.g. by doing a <tt>man cvs</tt>.

In the following we will discuss the options when creating a repository with the KAppWizard

<descrip>
<tag/VCS Location:/ This is the CVS root directory where the project source tree will be imported and where 
commits, checkouts and updates take place.
<tag/Repository in CVS/ This is the module name given for your project. As this is the same as your project
directory you can큧 change that.
<tag/Vendor Tag/ this is a tag for the entire branch
<tag/Log Message/ is the first log message entry of the new module. When adding or commiting to the 
repository, you will be asked for a log message each time to document your changes to the repository source 
tree.
<tag/Release Tag/ this specifies the tag under which your project source tree can be found, meaning that you 
can create several projects with the same module name in the CVS root which differ in the tag, so you can work
on different branches of the same project. Example: KDE 2 is developed under the tag HEAD (default tag), KDE 
1.1.2. can be found in the tag KDE_1_1_2_RELEASE.
</descrip> 

After creating your project with the KAppWizard, the CVS support option is already set for your project, so 
you can commit and add changes in the way described below in the section "Using CVS Commands".


<sect>Enabling CVS Support
<p>
As CVS support is most often only needed by professionals or companies as well as by KDE developers maintaining their project over the
KDE CVS server, using the CVS commands of KDevelop is optional. To enable the CVS commands, open the Project-Options dialog and change
the option for Version Control to "CVS".

<sect>Using CVS Commands
<p>
Then the following commands are available in the LFV and RFV by context menus:

Over a file not included in the repository:
<itemize>
<item><bf/Add to Repository/: adds the file to the repository. The file is set up to be added and will be introduced to the repository
on the next <tt/commit/ command that includes the directory where the added file is located locally.
</itemize>

Over a file included in the repository:
<itemize>
<item><bf/Update/: update the selected file with the CVS version
<item><bf/Commit/: commit the selected file to the CVS repository
<item><bf/Remove from Repository/: remove the file from the repository
</itemize>

Over a folder:
<itemize>
<item><bf/Add/: adds the folder to the repository
<item><bf/Remove/: removes the folder from the repository
<item><bf/Update/: update the folder recursively to be in sync with the repository
<item><bf/Commit/: commit any changes recursively to the repository
</itemize>

The CVS commands all require a working network connection to the CVS server. When invoking a command, you will be shown a dialog with
the command sent to the CVS server and the retrieved output. Thereby you can control what actually happens and if the command was
successful or not.

As the CVS commands of KDevelop only work with the <tt/cvs/ system command and its commandline options, you should have no trouble to
use the cvs features.

<chapt>General Configuration<label id="General Configuration">
<p>

This chapter describes how you can set your individual preferences about how KDevelop works. All settings addressed below can be
found by the according entry in the Options-menu.

<sect>Configuring the Tools Menu<label id="Configuring the Tools Menu">
<p><nidx/configuring the Tools-menu/<nidx/"Options"-menu/

As KDevelop supports the use of third-party programs within it's user interface, you are able to <idx/configure/ any program that suits
your needs towards application development. This can be done by adding programs to the already pre-defined ones in the
<idx/"Tools"-menu/. To change the tools-menu, select "<idx/Tools/" from the "Options" menu. This dialog allows to specify the entry
name, program and additional command line options you want to pass to the execution. To remove a program from the menu, select the
entry name and choose "Delete". To add a program, specify the menuentry, where a & is used as a menu-accelerator; you may compare the
already configured entries with the entry list. Select the binary and pass your commandline options (use %S to get the name of the
current open file and %D for the project directory). Select whether to capture the output of the Tool (displayed in the "messages" 
and "stderr" panes). Then hit "Add" and the entry is added to the list. After leaving the <idx/configuration dialog/, the tools-menu 
updates itself, so the new configuration is already usable without restarting KDevelop.

<sect>File Viewer Options
<p><nidx/file viewers/

The Logical File Viewer can be configured by context menus completely. As it's intention is to separate files logically to keep a
better overview over complex projects, one of the most used configurations is to create file groups. Those can be set by opening the
context menu with a right mouse button click over the project icon displayed at the root of the tree. The menu offers:
<itemize>
<item><idx/New File/: Opens the <idx/New File/ dialog. Equals to the menubar command "File"-"New"
<item><idx/New Class/: Opens the Classgenerator to create a new class. Equals to the menubar command "Project"-"<idx/New
Class/"<nidx/"Project"-menu/
<item>New Group: Opens a dialog to create a new group. There, set the group name and the file filter for
the <idx/project files/ that will be displayed in this group.
<item>Show relative path: displays the files with their path name starting from the main project directory if checked; otherwise only
the filename is shown.
</itemize>

Over a group folder, the according context menu offers:
<itemize>
<item>New Group: Opens the New Group dialog as in the context menu described above.
<item>Remove group: removes the group from the <idx/LFV/.
<item>Properties: Opens the properties of the group. There, you can edit the file filters by a list of wildcards separated by commas.
</itemize>


<sect><idx/KDevelop Setup/<label id="KDevelop Setup">
<p>
<bf><idx/Make-command/:</bf>
The General Options dialog lets you configure KDevelop's general settings.
First, you should set the <idx/make-command/ available on your system. If the selected program does not exist,
KDevelop will warn you the next time you're invoking a make command.

<bf><idx/Autosave/:</bf>

If Autosave is checked, KDevelop will save all changed files periodically.  The autosaving time range can be set to 3, 5, 15 or 30 minutes.


<bf><idx/Autoswitch/:</bf>

If Autoswitch is enabled, the KDevelop windows will switch on and off according to the usage context, e.g.  if you switch to a
documentation in the Help-menu, the Documentation browser will be opened, together with the documentation tree and the <idx/output/
window turned off.

<bf><idx/Startup/:</bf>

For starting KDevelop, you have the option to enable/disable the <idx/start-logo/ to be shown during the time KDevelop loads.
Further, if you don't like the last project to be opened on startup, you can disable the default behavior.

<sect>Changing <idx/Keyboard Shortcuts/<label id="Changing Keyboard Shortcuts">
<p>
The Configure Keys dialog lets you configure the KDevelop key bindings. Note that global keys can be configured in the
KDE Control Center, such as open file and print.  A key function can be configured by choosing the menu entry. Then the
configuration can be changed by checking values like the Alt / Ctrl key etc.

<sect>Documentation<label id="Documentation">
<p>
<sect1>Directories<nidx/documentation path/
<p>
For setting up the <idx/documentation browser/ to work correctly, KDevelop needs some information about where the <idx/HTML/-documentation
is placed on the system. Therefore, the Documentation Path properties dialog needs the path of the Qt- online documentation in <idx/HTML/
as well as the path to the KDE-Library documentation.

Usually, the <idx/Qt-Documentation/ is placed in the same directory where Qt is installed; e.g. if Qt resides in /usr/local/qt, the path
you have to enter is /usr/local/qt/html. For the KDE- Documentation, you have to set the directory to the root of the
documentation, assumed all KDE-Libs documentation resides in the same directory. Both path's can be selected by pressing the
according buttons, displaying a path-selection. If your system doesn't contain the documentation for the KDE-libs,  you should
first enter the next <idx/configuration dialog/, Update <idx/KDE-Documentation/. This will create the documentation to a path of your choice,
also setting the KDE Library Doc path automatically.

<sect1>Options
<p>
<sect2>Update <idx/KDE-Documentation/
<p>
For those users who don't have a recent documentation of the <idx/KDE-libraries/, especially the documentation for the files
installed on the system, the Update <idx/KDE-Documentation/ dialog creates a new one or updates existing documentations. This
function requires your system to have <idx/KDoc/ and qt2kdoc installed, included in the <idx/KDE-SDK/ package. First of, you have
to set up the path to your recent kdelibs sources, which is not the include-path for KDE ! Just enter the path to the sources, like:
/home/rnolden/kdelibs-1.1/.

Then, you can choose three different installation modes, as:

<itemize>
<item> Delete old Documentation and  install to recent Documentation-path:  this assumes that you already have a documentation
installed and is placed in the path the Documentation Path-dialog was entered. This will delete all documentation and install the
newly generated documentation into the recent path.
<item> Delete old Documentation and install to new Documentation-path:   this will result in deleting the old documentation as
well as above, but gives you the choice to set up a new documentation place.
<item> Leave old Documentation untouched and install to new Documentation path:   This is recommended for a new generation of
the kdelibs documentation for users who didn't have one before and for those who want to keep the last documentation for an older
kdelibs version.
</itemize>

The "new KDE Libs Documentation path" is to be set  for option 2 and 3 of the installation mode.  This is also recommended for
users who generate a new documentation from scratch.

After pressing the OK button, KDevelop will create a subdirectory "<idx/KDoc/-reference" in the documentation path containing the <idx/KDoc/
reference files.  First, the qt library documentation <idx/classes/ will be indexed to connect the Qt documentation with the
documentation to be generated for the kdelibs.  So it is important that you have set up the Qt documentation path first to ensure
that it can be found by <tt/qt2kdoc/. Finally, the KDE libs will be indexed and the documentation will be build with
cross-references to give browsing the most functionality.

<comment><bf>NOTE:</bf> When using KDoc 2, you can add a set of documentation for the the libraries in the KDE-Base and KOffice
package. To do this, create the KDE-Libs documentation as described above. Then reopen the dialog and choose the path to the
<tt>kdoc.rules</tt> file in the kdebase package resp. the koffice package, which is located in kdebase in the root directory of the
sources, in KOffice in koffice/lib. Select option 3 (Leave old Documentation untouched) and leave the output path below that option as
it is. This will keep the kdelibs documentation and generate the kdebase-libraries (resp. the koffice-libraries) documentation to the
same location with cross-references to the kdelibs documentation additionally. After generating the documentation the libraries are
available in the documentation tree automatically. For further KDE packages coming with additional libraries you should look for the
<tt>kdoc.rules</tt> file to generate additional documentation as with the KDE-Base and KOffice packages.</comment>


<sect2>Create Search Database
<p>
The Create Search Database dialog, accessed via the create-button, allows the programmer to create a database to search for a
keyword interactively.  To create and use the documentation search function, you must have the program <idx/glimpse/ 4.0 or ht://Dig 
installed.
Preset are the options to index the given KDE-Library documentation as well as the <idx/Qt-Documentation/, assuming the path to the
documentation files were set in the "Documentation Path" dialog of the options- menu.   Additionally, the index can include
directories the user can set up himself by the "additional directories to index"-field.  After setting a path to an additional
directory, the "Add" - button must be pushed to set the path.  A path once set can be removed from the index by selecting the path
in the path field and pushing "Remove". Furthermore, the user is offered three different modes for the index size: tiny, small and
medium.  The higher the index size, the more the index files will grow. On the other hand, a search in a bigger search-database
will be faster and more successful, so we suggest choosing a "medium" size. For using the search function, see section
<ref id="Using the Documentation Browser" name="Using the Documentation Browser">.

<sect2>Create also KDOC-reference of your project
<p>
This option allows you to create a cross-reference file for your project when generating the API documentation 
with KDoc. The cross-reference file will be placed in the references directory and make your project available 
in the documentation tree. If you don큧 have write access to the directory containing the reference files you 
have to uncheck this option to generate the API documentation without errors.  
 
<sect>Debugger <label id="Debugger">
<p>
The default setup for KDevelop is to use <ref id="The Internal Debugger" name="the internal debugger">. Click on "Use external
debugger" if you wish to use a different debugger and enter the name of the debugger to use. See your debuggers documentation on
how to run it.
Selecting the internal debugger enables an additional set of options you can choose from:
<p>
<itemize>
<item>Display static members: Displaying static members makes gdb slower in producing data within kde and qt. It may change 
the "signature" of the data which QString and friends rely on. But if you need to debug into these values then check this option.
<item>Display mangled names: When displaying the disassembled code you can select to see the methods mangled names. 
However, non-mangled names are easier to read.
<item>Try setting BPs on lib load: This will try to set pending breakpoints on loading a library. If GDB hasn't seen a library that will be 
loaded via "dlopen" then it will refuse to set a breakpoint in that code. We can get gdb to stop on a library load and hence try to set 
the pending breakpoints. See <ref id="Shared libraries and breakpoints" name="Shared libraries and breakpoints"> for more details 
and a "gotcha" relating to this behaviour. If you are not "dlopen"ing libs, leave this off.
<item>Enable floating toolbar: This will allow you to use the floating toolbar to control the debugger in addition to the menu and buttons. 
The toolbar is most useful for debugging GUI applications. For details see <ref id="The floating toolbar" name="The floating toolbar">.
<item>Enable separate terminal for application i/o: This allows you to enter terminal input when your application contains
terminal input code (eg cin, fgets etc.). If you use terminal input in your app, then tick this option. Otherwise leave this off.
</itemize>

<sect>Setting Paths <label id="Setting Paths">
<p>
On the paths tab you can enter the paths to your Qt 2.x and KDE 2 installations as well as where to create new projects. To learn 
more about installing Qt 2.x / KDE 2 and configuring KDevelop for Qt 2.x and KDE 2 read the
<htmlurl url="tutorial/index.html" name="KDE Application Tutorials">.

The default location for KDevelop to create new projects is in the user's home directory. If you want to change this behaviour you 
can enter the desired location into the default project path field.

<chapt>Questions and Answers<label id="Questions and Answers">
<p>
This section addresses questions by users that were answered by the KDevelop Team or by their supporters on the KDevelop
mailing list during experiences with the current versions of KDevelop as well as bug reporting in general.

<sect><idx/Bug Reporting/ <label id="Bug Reporting">
<p>
Another improvement of KDevelop is the integrated bug-reporting system via email. If you experience a bug, you have the option to send
the KDevelop development team a bug report either by your email-client or by the bug-report dialog. All bug-reports are collected on
the KDevelop web site and can be reviewed on <htmlurl url="http://bugs.kde.org//db/pa/lkdevelop.html" name="http://bugs.kde.org//db/pa/lkdevelop.html">. 

To send bug reports, please use the email address <htmlurl url="mailto:submit@bugs.kde.org" name="submit@bugs.kde.org">. If you want to use KDevelop for direct bug-reporting, choose
"Bug Report" from the <idx/Help-menu/. You are presented the report dialog that lets you enter all necessary information about the
bug you found. After pressing "OK", the dialog's contents is sent there automatically.

<sect>Where to get Information
<p>
<bf>Q:</bf> I have a question which is not addressed in the FAQ file, nor in the manuals of KDevelop. Where should I turn to ?

<bf>A:</bf>  In any case send all requests that are regarding KDevelop by subscribing to the KDevelop mailing list at <htmlurl url="mailto:kdevelop-request@barney.cs.uni-potsdam.de" name = "kdevelop-request@barney.cs.uni-potsdam.de">. Send a mail with an empty header and
"subscribe youremailaddres" as contents; then you can participate on the discussions. All questions should go there and will be addressed there as well.
If you stick to that, you will get the most help by the developers and all users having the same problems, as well as helping to keep
the FAQ up to date.

The <idx/KDevelop Homepage/ at <url url="http://www.kdevelop.org"> also contains a <idx/mailing-list/ archive that allows you to browse
the mails already send by the subscribers, so you should look there first as most problems should have been addressed already by the
team or other users.

<sect>Library and System Problems
<p>

<bf>Q:</bf> Wrong JPEG library version: library is 61, caller expects 62

<bf>A:</bf>  There are 2 ways.
<enum>
<item> When the kdelibs are installed it installs header files for the
 jpeg libraries, these are version 61,  however most distributions
 (Redhat) use version 62 libraries. To fix  this just remove jpeglib.h
 from /opt/kde/include. The pukka include  file for version 62 should
 then be picked up. However looking at the  error message above it may
 be the other way round, in any case ensure  you only have on version
 of the header file, the library and that  they are consistent.

 It is useful to use the locate command to verify that I have
 the correct version of a library and header files e.g.
 updatedb
 locate libjpeg
 locate jpeglib

<item> You must recompiled kdesupport without jpeg
 library (./<idx/configure/ --with-libjpeg --with-libgif).

<bf>Q:</bf> Configure complains about the Qt version not being between 1.44 and 2.00

<bf>A:</bf> You probably have Qt2.00 installed on your system, and this messes up ./configure. For the purpose of compiling
KDevelop you should set QTDIR to the correct directory.

<bf>Q:</bf> Configure complains about not being able to compile a small KDE application. Examining config.log reveals that it
can't find the library libXext.

<bf>A:</bf> Install the package xdevel

<bf>Q:</bf> I큟 already running a KDE 2 snapshot and I want to use KDevelop under KDE 2. What is the best way to do this ?

<bf>A:</bf> As KDevelop for KDE 2 is currently under development, you should consider using the current stable 1.x release of
KDevelop for production usage. Running KDevelop 1.x under KDE 2 can be done by creating a shell-script:

   #/bin/bash
   QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt-1.44 export QTDIR
   KDEDIR=/opt/kde export KDEDIR
   exec /opt/kde/bin/kdevelop

   Save this file as e.g. kdevelop1 and set this file to executable with

   chmod 755 kdevelop1

   Then you can run KDevelop 1.x under KDE 2 by calling kdevelop1.
   For developing KDE 2 applications with KDevelop 1.x you have to set the correct
   path in the KDevelop Setup even if you큥e running KDevelop under KDE 2 !

<sect>Usage Questions
<p>
<bf>Q:</bf> I see the KDevelop does not allow for usage of the delete key (or backspace deleting when text is marked).

<bf>A:</bf>  go to "Options"->"Editor" and make sure that "Delete on Input" is enabled, then backspace and delete works.


<bf>Q:</bf> If I add files to my project, will they be automatically included and compiled ?

<bf>A:</bf> Yes, they are included in the <idx/Makefile.am/'s then and if you make a "Rebuild All" (./<idx/configure/ updates the <idx/Makefile/s), your new
added files will be included as well.

<bf>Q:</bf> If I removed a file, I get some weird <idx/Linker/ messages. What is wrong with my project ?

<bf>A:</bf> If the removed file is a header file, that is automatically processed by automoc (running the Qt-Meta-Object-Compiler
automatically on all headers), your removed header is still present as a moc-generated *.moc.cpp file and compiled.  Remove the
according *.moc.cpp file and rebuild the project.

<bf>Q:</bf> Configure complains about not being able to compile a small KDE
application. Examining config.log reveals that it can't find the library
libXext.

<bf>A:</bf> Install the package xdevel

<bf>Q:</bf> I큟 developing an application where I need to set -D options to the preprocessor. If I add these
in KDevelop to my project options, everything is ok, but when I distribute my package, the -D options set in
KDevelop are not used. What do I have to do to make this work ?

<bf>A:</bf> Edit the file configure.in in your toplevel source directory. Here, you have to enter somewhere at
the beginning:

CXXFLAGS=$(CXXFLAGS) " -DYOURDEFINE"
AC_SUBST(CXXFLAGS)


<bf>Q:</bf> I큟 already running a KDE 2 snapshot and I want to use KDevelop under KDE 2. What is the best way
to do this ?

<bf>A:</bf> As KDevelop for KDE 2 is currently under development, you should consider using the current stable
1.x release of KDevelop for production usage. Running KDevelop 1.x under KDE 2 can be done by creating a
shell-script:

#/bin/bash
QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt-1.44 export QTDIR
KDEDIR=/opt/kde export KDEDIR
exec /opt/kde/bin/kdevelop

Save this file as e.g. kdevelop1 and set this file to executable with

chmod 755 kdevelop1

Then you can run KDevelop 1.x under KDE 2 by calling kdevelop1.
For developing KDE 2 applications with KDevelop 1.x you have to set the correct path in the KDevelop Setup
even if you큥e running KDevelop under KDE 2 !

<bf>Q:</bf> I'm using a KDevelop 1.4 which is already KDE2 enabled. There is no dialog editor any more. How do I create my dialogs ?

<bf>A:</bf> Since KDevelop 1.4 the QT designer is used for creating dialogs. But not only the tool has changed but also the way
how dialogs are designed and used from within KDevelop. To create a new dialog choose new from the file dialog and create a new QT
designer (*.ui) file. Now the designer is opened and you can develop your dialog. ATTENTION: most QT packages (*.deb,*.rpm) does
not include support for KDE widgets. You need this to use e.g. KListView or other KDE widgets in your dialogs.  After creating
the dialog, you inherit your dialog class from the newly created dialog.

<bf>Q:</bf> I have downloaded the QT-2.2.x packages from ftp.kde.org and there are now KDE widgets available in the designer. How
can I get them ? A: You have to recompile QT with ./configure -kde as additional option. Remember to set $KDEDIR and $QTDIR to the
appropriate directories. After doing so you have an option KDE in the tools menue of the designer.

<bf>Q:</bf> I use RedHat Linux with KDevelop and tried to recompile the QT library with -kde in order to use the designer with KDE
widget support but  during configure it says that $KDEDIR does not contain a valid KDE installation ? A: RedHat uses a
non-standard directory setting with KDE. The normal case would be that the libs are in $KDEDIR/lib, binaries in $KDEDIR/bin
and includes in $KDEDIR/include. RedHat uses /usr as $KDEDIR but $KDEDIR/include/kde as directory for  header files. Therefore
configure from QT fails to detect the correct directories. It searches dcopserver in the binaries folder and the header files in
their folder. So if you choose $KDEDIR to be /usr, configure can't find the includes. A possible solution for this is to create a
/usr/local/kde     directory and set symlinks to /usr/bin and /usr/include/kde in this "pseudo" kde dir. Then export
KDEDIR=/usr/local/kde and do the ./configure -kde. After compiling QT you have the KDE entries in the tools menu of the QT
designer.

<bf>Q:</bf> Is there any HOWTO available on how to work with QT designer made dialogs ?

<bf>A:</bf> Yes, there is a great tutorial on http://women.kde.org/docs/tut_kdevelop/

<bf>Q:</bf> I have installed htdig but there is now htsearch available ?

<bf>A:</bf> On e.g. RedHat systems the htsearch executable is placed in the /cgi-bin dir of apache. You can create symlinks in /usr/bin or simply add this path ro ~/.bashrc

<bf>Q:</bf> I have htdig, htmerge and htsearch available but I get an error message thet the config file of htdig could not be
found or is invalid ? A: Read README.htdig in the source directory tree and create a htdig.conf file. Then copy it to $KDEDIR/share/apps/kdevelop/tools. Now create your search index with the kdevelop setup menu.

<chapt>Thanks
<p>
We like to express special thanks to all of our family members and friends who supported us in several ways
to let us construct and improve KDevelop.

Further, we thank  Jochen Wilhelmy  for offering his program kwrite and his help on integrating it into KDevelop.

Thanks also to the KDE team and Stephan Kulow, who gave us the possibility to work on KDevelop via CVS

We hope that our free work on this product will lead to a better acceptance of Free Software and its
development. Without the help and idealism of many, the KDevelop IDE would never have been realized in such a
short period of time and we're proud that so many users already have reported good experience and brought
KDevelop to it's destiny: helping free software programmers to build a better world where users have the
freedom of choice.
