<P>
<P>This chapter describes how you can set your individual preferences about how KDevelop works. All settings addressed below can be
found by the according entry in the Options-menu.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Configuring the "></A> <A NAME="ss14.1">14.1 Configuring the "Tools" Menu</A>
Tools" Menu"></H3>

<P>
<!--
configuring the Tools-menu
-->
<!--
"Options"-menu
-->
<P>As KDevelop supports the use of third-party programs within it's user interface, you are able to configure any program that suits
your needs towards application development. This can be done by adding programs to the already pre-defined ones in the
"Tools"-menu. To change the tools-menu, select "Tools" from the "Options" menu. This dialog allows to specify the entry
name, program and additional command line options you want to pass to the execution. To remove a program from the menu, select the
entry name and choose "Delete". To add a program, specify the menuentry, where a &amp; is used as a menu-accelerator; you may compare the
already configured entries with the entry list. Select the binary and pass your commandline options. Then hit "Add" and the entry
is added to the list. After leaving the configuration dialog, the tools-menu updates itself, so the new configuration is already
usable without restarting KDevelop.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss14.2">14.2 File Viewer Options</A>
</H3>

<P>
<!--
file viewers
-->
<P>The Logical File Viewer can be configured by context menus completely. As it's intention is to separate files logically to keep a
better overview over complex projects, one of the most used configurations is to create file groups. Those can be set by opening the
context menu with a right mouse button click over the project icon displayed at the root of the tree. The menu offers:
<UL>
<LI>New File: Opens the New File dialog. Equals to the menubar command "File"-"New"</LI>
<LI>New Class: Opens the Classgenerator to create a new class. Equals to the menubar command "Project"-"New
Class"
<!--
"Project"-menu
-->
</LI>
<LI>New Group: Opens a dialog to create a new group. There, set the group name and the file filter for
the project files that will be displayed in this group.</LI>
<LI>Show relative path: displays the files with their path name starting from the main project directory if checked; otherwise only
the filename is shown.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Over a group folder, the according context menu offers:
<UL>
<LI>New Group: Opens the New Group dialog as in the context menu described above.</LI>
<LI>Remove group: removes the group from the LFV.</LI>
<LI>Properties: Opens the properties of the group. There, you can edit the file filters by a list of wildcards separated by commas.</LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="KDevelop Setup"></A> <A NAME="ss14.3">14.3 KDevelop Setup</A>
</H3>

<P><B>Make-command:</B>
The General Options dialog lets you configure KDevelop's general settings.
First, you should set the make-command available on your system. If the selected program does not exist,
KDevelop will warn you the next time you're invoking a make command.
<P><B>Autosave:</B>
<P>If Autosave is checked, KDevelop will save all changed files periodically.  The autosaving time range can be set to 3, 5, 15 or 30 minutes.
<P>
<P><B>Autoswitch:</B>
<P>If Autoswitch is enabled, the KDevelop windows will switch on and off according to the usage context, e.g.  if you switch to a
documentation in the Help-menu, the Documentation browser will be opened, together with the documentation tree and the output
window turned off.
Startup:
<P>For starting KDevelop, you have the option to enable/disable the start-logo to be shown during the time KDevelop loads.
Further, if you don't like the last project to be opened on startup, you can disable the default behavior.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Changing Keyboard Shortcuts"></A> <A NAME="ss14.4">14.4 Changing Keyboard Shortcuts</A>
</H3>

<P>The Configure Keys dialog lets you configure the KDevelop key bindings. Note that global keys can be configured in the
KDE Control Center, such as open file and print.  A key function can be configured by choosing the menu entry. Then the
configuration can be changed by checking values like the Alt / Ctrl key etc.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Documentation"></A> <A NAME="ss14.5">14.5 Documentation</A>
</H3>

<P>
<H4>Directories<!--documentation path--></H4>

<P>For setting up the documentation browser to work correctly, KDevelop needs some information about where the HTML-documentation
is placed on the system. Therefore, the Documentation Path properties dialog needs the path of the Qt- online documentation in HTML
as well as the path to the KDE-Library documentation.
<P>Usually, the Qt-Documentation is placed in the same directory where Qt is installed; e.g. if Qt resides in /usr/local/qt, the path
you have to enter is /usr/local/qt/html. For the KDE- Documentation, you have to set the directory to the root of the
documentation, assumed all KDE-Libs documentation resides in the same directory. Both path's can be selected by pressing the
according buttons, displaying a path-selection. If your system doesn't contain the documentation for the KDE-libs,  you should
first enter the next configuration dialog, Update KDE-Documentation. This will create the documentation to a path of your choice,
also setting the KDE Library Doc path automatically.
<P>
<H4>Options</H4>

<P>
<H4>Update KDE-Documentation</H4>

<P>For those users who don't have a recent documentation of the KDE-libraries, especially the documentation for the files
installed on the system, the Update KDE-Documentation dialog creates a new one or updates existing documentations. This
function requires your system to have KDoc and qt2KDoc installed, included in the KDE-SDK package. First of, you have
to set up the path to your recent kdelibs sources, which is not the include-path for KDE ! Just enter the path to the sources, like:
/home/rnolden/kdelibs-1.1/.
<P>Then, you can choose three different installation modes, as:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Delete old Documentation and  install to recent Documentation-path:  this assumes that you already have a documentation
installed and is placed in the path the Documentation Path-dialog was entered. This will delete all documentation and install the
newly generated documentation into the recent path.</LI>
<LI> Delete old Documentation and install to new Documentation-path:   this will result in deleting the old documentation as
well as above, but gives you the choice to set up a new documentation place.</LI>
<LI> Leave old Documentation untouched and install to new Documentation path:   This is recommended for a new generation of
the kdelibs documentation for users who didn't have one before and for those who want to keep the last documentation for an older
kdelibs version.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The "new KDE Libs Documentation path" is to be set  for option 2 and 3 of the installation mode.  This is also recommended for
users who generate a new documentation from scratch.
<P>After pressing the OK button, KDevelop will create a subdirectory "KDoc-reference" in the documentation path containing the KDoc
reference files.  First, the qt library documentation classes will be indexed to connect the Qt documentation with the
documentation to be generated for the kdelibs.  So it is important that you have set up the Qt documentation path first to ensure
that it can be found by <CODE>qt2kdoc</CODE>. Finally, the KDE libs will be indexed and the documentation will be build with
cross-references to give browsing the most functionality.
<P>
<H4>Create Search Database</H4>

<P>The Create Search Database dialog, accessed via the create-button, allows the programmer to create a database to search for a
keyword interactively.  To create and use the documentation search function, you must have the program glimpse 4.0 or ht://Dig 
installed.
Preset are the options to index the given KDE-Library documentation as well as the Qt-Documentation, assuming the path to the
documentation files were set in the "Documentation Path" dialog of the options- menu.   Additionally, the index can include
directories the user can set up himself by the "additional directories to index"-field.  After setting a path to an additional
directory, the "Add" - button must be pushed to set the path.  A path once set can be removed from the index by selecting the path
in the path field and pushing "Remove". Furthermore, the user is offered three different modes for the index size: tiny, small and
medium.  The higher the index size, the more the index files will grow. On the other hand, a search in a bigger search-database
will be faster and more successful, so we suggest choosing a "medium" size. For using the search function, see section
<A HREF="index-6.html#Using the Documentation Browser">Using the Documentation Browser</A>.
