<P><EM>Howto for the KDE Desktop COmmunincations Protocol implementation</EM>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Motivation and Background</A>
</H3>

<P>The motivation behind building a protocol like DCOP is simple.  For
the past year, we have been attempting to enable interprocess
communication between KDE applications. KDE already has an extremely
simple IPC mechanism called KWMcom, which is (was!) used for communicating
between the panel and the window manager for instance.  It is about as
simple as it gets, passing messages via X Atoms.  For this reason it
is limited in the size and complexity of the data that can be passed
(X atoms must be small to remain efficient) and it also makes it so
that X is required.  CORBA was thought to be a more effective IPC/RPC
solution.  However, after a year of attempting to make heavy use of
CORBA in KDE, we have realized that it is a bit slow and memory
intensive for simple use.  It also has no authentication available.
<P>What we really needed was an extremely simple protocol with basic
authorization, along the lines of MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE, as used by X.  It
would not be able to do NEARLY what CORBA was able to do, but for the
simple tasks required it would be sufficient. Some examples of such
tasks might be an application sending a message to the panel saying,
"I have started, stop displaying the 'application starting' wait
state," or having a new application that starts query to see if any
other applications of the same name are running.  If they are, simply
call a function on the remote application to create a new window,
rather than starting a new process.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Implementation</A>
</H3>

<P>DCOP is a simple IPC/RPC mechanism built to operate over sockets.
Either unix domain sockets or tcp/ip sockets are supported. DCOP is
built on top of the Inter Client Exchange (ICE) protocol, which comes
standard as a part of X11R6 and later. It also depends on Qt, but
beyond that it does not require any other libraries. Because of this,
it is extremely lightweight, enabling it to be linked into all KDE
applications with low overhead.
<P>
<H4>Model</H4>

<P>The model is simple.  Each application using DCOP is a client.  They
communicate to each other through a DCOP server, which functions like
a traffic director, dispatching messages/calls to the proper
destinations.  All clients are peers of each other.
<P>Two types of actions are possible with DCOP: "send and forget"
messages, which do not block, and "calls," which block waiting for
some data to be returned.
<P>Any data that will be sent is serialized (marshalled, for you CORBA
types) using the built-in QDataStream operators available in all of the
Qt classes.  This is fast and easy.  Currently, there is no
type checking or parameter checking available for RPC, but this may be
provided at some time in the future in the form of a simple IDL-like
compiler (NOTE: 5 days later the IDL compiler is already started;
look in dcopidl/).  Until that is available, you will have to code
some things by hand that normally the compiler or CORBA take care of
automatically, but it is not a lot of work.
<P>
<H4>Establishing the Connection</H4>

<P>KApplication has gained a method called "KApplication::dcopClient()"
which returns a pointer to a DCOPClient instance.  The first time this
method is called, the client class will be created.  DCOPClients have
unique identifiers attached to them which are based on what
KApplication::name() returns.  In fact, if there is only a single
instance of the program running, the appId will be equal to
KApplication::name().
<P>To actually enable DCOP communication to begin, you must use
DCOPClient::attach().  This will attempt to attach to the DCOP server.
If no server is found or there is any other type of error, attach()
will return false.  Applications which are DCOP-enabled should
probably do something like this at startup time:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
client = kApp->dcopClient();
if (!client->attach()) {
  QMessageBox::error(this, i18n("Error connecting to DCOP server"),
                     i18n("There was an error connecting to the Desktop\n"
                          "communications server.  Please make sure that\n"
                          "the 'dcopserver' process has been started, and\n"
                          "then try again.\n"));
  exit(1);
}
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>After connecting with the server via DCOPClient::attach(), you need to
register this appId with the server so it knows about you.  Otherwise,
you are communicating anonymously.  Use the
DCOPClient::registerAs(const QCString &amp;name) to do so.  In the simple
case:
<HR>
<PRE>
/*
 * returns the appId that is actually registered, which _may_ be
 * different from what you passed
 */
appId = client->registerAs(kApp->name());
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>If you never retrieve the DCOPClient pointer from KApplication, the
object will not be created and thus there will be no memory overhead.
<P>You may also detach from the server by calling DCOPClient::detach().
If you wish to attach again you will need to re-register as well.  If
you only wish to change the ID under which you are registered, simply
call DCOPClient::registerAs() with the new name.
<P>
<P>
<H4>Sending Data to a Remote Application</H4>

<P>To actually communicate, you have one of two choices.  You may either
call the "send" or the "call" method.  Both methods require three
identification parameters: an application identifier, a remote object,
a remote function. Sending is asynchronous (i.e. it returns immediately)
and may or may not result in your own application being sent a message at
some point in the future. Then "send" requires one and "call" requires
two data parameters.
<P>The remote object must be specified as an object hierarchy.  That is,
if the toplevel object is called "fooObject" and has the child
"barObject", you would reference this object as "fooObject/barObject".
Functions must be described by a full function signature.  If the
remote function is called "doIt", and it takes an int, it would be
described as "doIt(int)".  Please note that the return type is not
specified here, as it is not part of the function signature (or at
least the C++ understanding of a function signature).  You will get
the return type of a function back as an extra parameter to
DCOPClient::call().  See the section on call() for more details.
<P>In order to actually get the data to the remote client, it must be
"serialized" via a QDataStream operating on a QByteArray. This is how
the data parameter is "built". A few examples will make clear how this
works.
<P>Say you want to call "doIt" as described above, and not block (or wait
for a response).  You will not receive the return value of the remotely
called function, but you will not hang while the RPC is processed either.
The return value of send() indicates whether DCOP communication succeeded
or not.
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
QByteArray params;
QDataStream stream(params, IO_WriteOnly);
params &lt;&lt; 5;
if (!client->send("someAppId", "fooObject/barObject", "QString doIt(int)",
                  params))
  qDebug("there was some error using DCOP.");
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>OK, now let's say we wanted to get the data back from the remotely
called function.  You have to execute a call() instead of a send().
The returned value will then be available in the data parameter "reply".
The actual return value of call() is still whether or not DCOP
communication was successful.
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
QByteArray params, reply;
QCString replyType;
QDataStream stream(params, IO_WriteOnly);
params &lt;&lt; 5;
if (!client->call("someAppId", "fooObject/barObject", "doIt(int)",
                  params, replyType, reply))
  qDebug("there was some error using DCOP.");
else {
  QDataStream stream2(reply, IO_ReadOnly);
  if (replyType == "QString") {
    QString result;
    stream2 >> result;
    print("the result is: %s",result.latin1());
  } else
    qDebug("doIt returned an unexpected type of reply!");
}
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<H4>Receiving Data via DCOP</H4>

<P>Currently the only real way to receive data from DCOP is to multiply
inherit from the normal class that you are inheriting (usually some
sort of QWidget subclass or QObject) as well as the DCOPObject class.
DCOPObject provides one very important method: DCOPObject::process().
This is a pure virtual method that you must implement in order to
process DCOP messages that you receive.  It takes a function
signature, QByteArray of parameters, and a reference to a QByteArray
for the reply data that you must fill in.
<P>Think of DCOPObject::process() as a sort of dispatch agent.  In the
future, there will probably be a precompiler for your sources to write
this method for you.  However, until that point you need to examine
the incoming function signature and take action accordingly.  Here is
an example implementation.
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
bool BarObject::process(const QCString &amp;fun, const QByteArray &amp;data,
                        QCString &amp;replyType, QByteArray &amp;replyData)
{
  if (fun == "doIt(int)") {
    QDataStream stream(data, IO_ReadOnly);
    int arg;
    QString res;
    stream >> arg;
    res = self->doIt(arg);
    QDataStream stream2(replyData, IO_WriteOnly);
    stream2 &lt;&lt; res;
    replyType = "QString";
    return true;
  } else {
    qDebug("unknown function call to BarObject::process()");
    return false;
  }
}
</PRE>

<H4>Performance Tests</H4>

<P>A few back-of-the-napkin tests folks:
<P>Code:
<HR>
<PRE>
#include &lt;kapp.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  KApplication *app;

  app = new KApplication(argc, argv, "testit");
  return app->exec();
}
</PRE>
<HR>

Compiled with:
<P>g++ -O2 -o testit testit.cpp -I$QTDIR/include -L$QTDIR/lib -lkdecore
<P>on Linux yields the following memory use statistics:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
VmSize:     8076 kB
VmLck:         0 kB
VmRSS:      4532 kB
VmData:      208 kB
VmStk:        20 kB
VmExe:         4 kB
VmLib:      6588 kB
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If I create the KApplication's DCOPClient, and call attach() and
registerAs(), it changes to this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
VmSize:     8080 kB
VmLck:         0 kB
VmRSS:      4624 kB

<P>Basically it appears that using DCOP causes 100k more memory to be
resident, but no more data or stack.  So this will be shared between all
processes, right?  100k to enable DCOP in all apps doesn't seem bad at
all. :)
<P>OK now for some timings.  Just creating a KApplication and then exiting
(i.e. removing the call to KApplication::exec) takes this much time:
<P>0.28user 0.02system 0:00.32elapsed 92%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (1084major+62minor)pagefaults 0swaps
<P>I.e. about 1/3 of a second on my PII-233.  Now, if we create our DCOP
object and attach to the server, it takes this long:
<P>0.27user 0.03system 0:00.34elapsed 87%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (1107major+65minor)pagefaults 0swaps
<P>I.e. about 1/3 of a second.  Basically DCOPClient creation and attaching
gets lost in the statistical variation ("noise").  I was getting times
between .32 and .48 over several runs for both of the example programs, so
obviously system load is more relevant than the extra two calls to
DCOPClient::attach and DCOPClient::registerAs, as well as the actual
DCOPClient constructor time.
