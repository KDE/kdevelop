TODO:
   
   - P1:
      - QString is not updated.

      - Don't send  "-file-list-exec-source-file" if *stopped response
        does not have any file name.      

      - Don't diable step button while stepping.

      - Fix moving breakpoints on editing files

      - Should not issue -stack-num-frames with high limit, should
        issue each time we request more frames.

      - Pressing tab in memory range dialog modified the edited file. 

      - Testing stepping into code for which gdb can't find the file or fullname.
         Test stepping (or stepi) into undebuggable code.

      - Test files without debug info

   - Incoming bug reports:



   - Check core files usage.

   - GDB controller should provide 'default MI error handler',
     that can be used when needed by specific commands.

   - Fix remote target dialog, which is confusing and requires
     to specify tree scripts!

   - Big projects

       - Add support for other special types (STL)

   - Breakpoints

       - Status display column is just ugly
     
       - Handle "out of breakpoints" message.

       - Check that changing breakpoint when program is running works sanely.
         Need to either disable breakpoints widget when debugger is busy, or
         stop debugger when we add new breakpoint.

      - Implement gdb -> KDevelop breakpoint addition for all existing
        breakpoint types.
  
      - Add shortcuts to context menu.

      - For function breakpoints, the 'file' property of breakpoint from
        gdb is not a fullname (gdb 6.4), so we don't find the file.

      - For function breakpoints with gdb CVS, clicking on marker corresponding
        to function breakpoint does not clear it, but adds a new one.

      - "Immediately leave function" breakpoint type.


   - Watchpoints redux:

       - Fix status display for watchpoints

       - Test loading of read watchpoints from session file.

       - Change "toogle watchpoint" into checkbox.

       - "Read watchpoint triggered" message disappears too soon.


   - Fix up the mess with relative vs. full names of files for breakpoints.

      
   UI cleanup:

       - The dialog box on watchpoint hit draws slowly initially.

       - Cntrl-Enter for "add watch".

       - Close all opened thread when opening other?

       - The dialog box shown in MI errors is ugly. Often, it contains names 
         of internal gdb functions, or no interest to outsiders.

       - Should strip formatting when copying from gdb output window.        

   Console command interaction:

       - Handle "Program exited" messages from CLI "continue".


   Code cleanup:

       - Rename FileLine to Code.

       - Kill raw char* manipulation.

       - Fix hardcoded color in framestack widget

       - Kill 'trimmableItem'.

   Minor tweaks:

       - Need some "scope" for error reporting. Say, we can try to set invalid
         breakpoint condition from session file, on debugger startup. Need to
         produce message like:
        "Error detected when setting condition for breakpoint 1", 
         not a pretty opaque error we get now.

       - Highlight type changes in variable widget

       - Highlight composite types changes?

       - Test that modifying breakpoint while application is running works.        

       - If remembered expresion includes dereferences pointer as a child,
          that child is still updated as we step.        

       - Error in 'finish' command (e.g. on the outer frame) hides the 
         current line indicator.
 
       - Should disable the 'finish' command on the outer frame.       

   Optimizations:

        - If we're in some function and looked at frame 0 and frame 1, and
          then run "finish", we need to reuse VarFrameRoot for previous frame
          1, which now became frame 0, no need to recreate it. Generally, need
          to preserve open/closed state of all variables for all scopes.




    

BUGS/ISSUES found:

   - "set edit off" breaks MI
   - no stop reason for stop on shared library load
   - using "interpreter mi -whatever" when already in MI
     mode causes gdb to output two "^done" messages and
     it confuses us.
   - No support for "character" format in -data-evaluate-expression 
     or -var-set-format
   - Some of the -stack* command operate on current frame unless one is
     specified, but -stack-list-arguments will print all frames.

   - Output of -thread-list-ids uses the following syntax

       {thread-id="1",thread-id="2"}

     which is neither tuple nor list.

   - Pending breakpoits broken in MI.


   - Varobj broken:

       - When entering new scope, we need to issue -stack-list-locals
         to get names of new varaibles in that scope.

   - When stopping inside undebuggable code (say, on watchpoint hit), 
     -file-list-exec-source-file reports the last valid source file.

   - It's not possible to find if intefiour is running or not.

  
   


Advantages of MI


- The information is easier to extract.

     - For watchpoint, getting the old and new value of
       watched expression for display is trivial. For CLI,
       this is tricky and not done in current code.
